# Impact of water deficit on growth, productivity, and water use efficiency in potato genotypes (*Solanum tuberosum* L.)

# Abstract

Drought stress is a serious constraint affecting yields of almost all crops worldwide. The problem is only expected to get worse with water deficits stemming from climate change and population expansion. Potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L) is one of the most important food crop worldwide and modern cultivars are highly sensitive to drought. The aim of the present work is to study the physiological responses of potato under water deficit condition. In order to explore the different responses and understand the mechanisms of tolerance to drought stress, we evaluated fifteen potato genotypes under well-watered (WW) and water deficit (WD) conditions for a range of agro-physiological traits. Critically, tolerant genotypes, CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219 and CIP398208.620, were able to preferentially put limited water toward tuber production rather than biomass. These genotypes have a high tuber production under WW conditions and increased photosynthetic activity and water use efficiency under WD. Variables such as harvest index (hi), root dry weight (rdw), relative chlorophyll content (rcc) and chlorophyll concentration (spad) can be used to select drought tolerant potato genotypes in breeding programs.
