# Impact of water deficit on growth, productivity, and water use efficiency in potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L.)


Drought stress is one of the major causes of damage and subsequent reduction in yield all crops worldwide and the problem is only expected to get worse with water deficits stemming from climate change and population expansion so it is need to be bred plants for improve water use efficiency and reduce the yield lost. Potato is one of most important food crop worldwide and modern cultivars are highly sensitive to soil drought. In this work, we aim to study the physiological responses potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L) under drought stress in controlled condition. In order to explore the different responses, we evaluated fifteen genotypes under well watered (WD) and water deficit (WD) conditions for a range of agro-physiological traits and understand the mechanisms of tolerance to drought stress in potato. Genotypes with better mechanisms for avoid the water shortage and maintain the yield production are CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219 and CIP398208.620 were able to preferentially use the limited water in tuber production rather than biomass accumulation. Multivariate analysis shown that this genotypes have a high production under WW conditions and increasing the phosyntetic activity under WD producing with better water use efficiency for tuber production (wue~t~). Variables such as harvest index (hi), root dry weigth (rdw), relative chrolopyll content (rcc) and chlorophyll concentration (spad) provide useful information for select potato genotypes under drought stress in breeding programs.
