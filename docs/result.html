<p>The drought treatment were apply at 35 day after planting (dap) and the fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw) shown differences 14 day since treatment application. Plants in WW were maintained the water availability in the pots between 70% and 100% while the restriction in the water supply for the WD treatment decrease the water availability until the finalization of the experiment when the plant in WD in average had less than 10% of ftsw, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:srl">7.1</a>A. In the case of the transpiration the plants in WD reduce the transpiration rate from 16 days after not water irrigation, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:srl">7.1</a>B.

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Multivariate analysis</h2>
<p>The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the two first dimension explain 64.9% of the variance in the experiment. In the first dimension trs (r=0.90), lfa (r=0.89), tbd (r=0.84), sla (r=0.83), tdw (r=0.77) and rwc (r=0.71) show a high correlation and association with WW treatment, in the other side the spad_76 (r=-0,77) shown an negatives correlation and association with WD treatment. In the second dimension the rdw (r=0.87), rdl (r=0.86) have a high correlation and associated at WD treatment and negate correlated with hi (-0.89) and twue (-0.9) and associated to WW treatment, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.2</a>A.</p>
<p>The clustering analysis show 5 groups and it could be associated in 2 different ways. The first association could by classified by the treatment applied, the blue and cyan are the well water treatments and the black and red associated at the water deficit treatment; and the second group in green, cyan and red color associated according to their tolerate to water stress because their correlated with twue, hi and tdw, traits important in the yield component, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.2</a>B.</p>
<p>The association between the cluster an the variables shown that the genotypes in the cluster 1 are positive correlated with the spad, rdl and rdw and negative correlated to hi, tdw, twue, sla. The genoytpes in the cluster 2 are only positive associated with the hi and negative associated with ldw, tdb, sdw. In the cluster 3 the genotypes are positive correlated at wue, twue and negative correlated for rwc, lop and sla. The cluster 4 positive association with rdw, ldw, lfa, sdw, trs and negative correlated with wue and twue. And the cluster 5 is associated with sla, tdw, rwc, lfa and negative associated with spad and rdw, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.2</a>.</p>

<p>SPAD units taken over the course of plant development (29, 59, 76, and 83 dap) showed that at 29 dap all plants were at the same stress level as no treatment difference was found, Table <a href="tables.html#tab:svt">7.3</a>. At 59, 76 and 83 the spad shown difference en each evaluation and at the end of the experiment the values were lower than at 29 dap and the WD values for all the genotypes were higher than the ones at WW conditions. The genotypes CIP398190.89 and CIP720088 had the lowest differences among treatments for spad at 83 dap (2.06 and 0.30, respectively), while CIP398203.244 and CIP398208.33 had the largest (14.48 and 17.54, respectively).</p>

<!-- Leaf relative water content (RWC) significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in response to WD in all the genotypes (Supplementary Table 1). The values ranged between 64.96% and 50.09% for CIP720088 and CIP398201.510, respectively. Differences in osmotic potential (OP) among genotypes and treatments were also significant (P < .001) (Supplementary Table 1). -->
<!-- The values of total biomass (kgDW.m-2) and total transpiration (L) were strongly and positively correlated across (r= 0.92, P < .0001) all genotypes and per treatment (Fig.5a). WUE was also correlated with both total biomass and tuber yield (r = 0 .55, p < .05; and r = 0.78, p < 0.001 respectively) (Figure 5b and Supplemental Table 1). The efficiency of use of transpired water was 34.9% higher in CIP397077.16, compared to CIP398180.612. Genotypic variability was also noted in terms of TDWS and HI and three clear groups (tolerant, medium, sensitive) can be distinguished based on TDWS and HI. CIP397077.16, UNICA, CIP398208.620, and Achirana-INTA were ranked as tolerant while CIP398203.244 was rated as sensitive (Figure 5c). The leaf (r = 0.79), stem (r = 0.69), and tuber biomass (r = 0.56) were also positively correlated with transpiration. Almost all characteristics evaluated showed significant differences between treatments (Supplementary Table 2). Only SPAD29, before the start of the drought treatment, and root length did not show significant differences.  -->

<div id="yield-components" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Yield components</h2>
<p>Differences existed among genotypes in total biomass dry weight (g) of well-watered (WW) plants at the end of the experiment, table. Water deficit (WD) treatment had a significant effect (P &lt; 0.001) with an average reduction of around 31% in comparison with the well-watered treatment <a href="tables.html#tab:svt">7.3</a>.</p>
<p>CIP398190.89 was the only genotype with a 5% increase in biomass, and CIP398208.219 was the most affected by WD (~44% reduction in comparison with WW). In terms of productivity, WD decreased tuber yield (kgDW.m2) across genotypes by an average of 39% (P &lt; 0.01), however, CIP398190.89 increased its productivity by 5%, while others like CIP398203.5 and CIP398203.244 presented up to 56% and 48% reduced tuber production (Figure 2a). CIP398190.89 had greater tuber dry weight (g) in WD compared to its yield in WW treatment, with a TDWS of 104.09%, indicating drought tolerance (Figure 1a). Most genotypes had similar performance under drought, such as UNICA (CIP392797.22) with 75.76% and CIP398208.33 with 71.9% TDWS. The genotypes CIP398203.244, CIP398208.219, and CIP398201.510 were among the most sensitive genotypes at 31.56, 46.75 and 48.88% respectively.</p>
<!-- Differences among genotypes (p<0.001) and treatments (p<0.01) were found for harvest index (HI) (Figure 2b). Dry matter partitioning in CIP3977077.16 and CIP398190.89 under WD as shown by HI were not significantly different from that of the WW treatment. A strong negative correlation among root length and HI was found in both treatments (r= -0.73) -->
<!-- The specific leaf area (SLA) reduction was 48% under WD compared to WW (Figure 2c). CIP398190.89 together with CIP398203.5 were among the clones with lowest reduction (24 and 21% respectively), while CIP398208.219, CIP398098.119, and CIP398208.704 were among the clones with highest SLA reduction (53, 65, and 64% respectively). -->
<!-- Water use efficiency (WUE) was generally higher in WD than WW plants (Figure 4a). Under WD treatment, CIP397077.16, CIP398208.620 and CIP398190.89 showed the highest efficiency (13.06, 12.03, and 11.59 g.L-1, respectively), while the lowest efficiencies (8.50 and 9.24 g.L-1) were presented by CIP398180.612 and CIP398203.5, respectively. CIP398208.620) (10.80 g.L-1 for WW and 12.03 g.L-1 for WD) and CIP398180.612 (8.36 g.L-1 for WW and 8.50 g.L-1) maintained similar WUE (higher or lower) in both treatments (Figure 3a). Tubers used a great portion of the water uptake (Figure 4b), at least for the tolerant genotypes (CIP398190.89, CIP397077.16, and UNICA), in which tubers either from WW or WD are alike (Sup.Fig.1). On the other hand, the sensitive genotype CIP398203.244 produced more leaves and stems rather than tubers.  -->
