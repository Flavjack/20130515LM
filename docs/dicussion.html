<p>Water stress triggered a range of morphological and physiological mechanisms in the potato genotypes tested, leading to different yield penalties and indicating a variety of survival strategies by potato. Most characteristics measure showed differences between treatments, pointing to their value in evaluating the impact of drought. Under WW conditions, soil can supply water at a steady rate to meet the transpiration demand. However, as the soil becomes dry, water flux from soil to root surface decreases and cannot satisfy the demand of transpiration. Additionally, in WD conditions, mineralization and supply of nutrients, especially N, is reduced, forcing the plant to use their resources efficiently as the only solution to not compromise yield (Motalebifard et al. 2013). According to (Songsri et al. 2009), enhanced extraction of water and nutrients from the soil due to large root system and long roots is a drought resistance mechanism in potato. But in our study showed that the minimal yield losses in some genotypes like CIP398190.89 under WD could be related to its ability to increase its wue<sub>t</sub>, by absorbing the limited water and nutrients available in the soil without changing have a high reduction in the final yield, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.3</a>.</p>
<p>Plant biomass accumulation, and consequently yield, was shown to be inextricably linked to transpiration <span class="citation">(Sinclair et al., <a href="references.html#ref-sinclair1984WaterUse" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>. A drought resistance mechanism can be the reduction of transpiration achieved by the reduction of leaf area with thick leaves often have greater photosynthetic capacity than thin leaves, due to their higher chlorophyll per leaf area counts (Songsri et al. 2009). Sensitive genotypes such as CIP398203.244 and CIP398201.510 preferred to produce leaves and more roots in preference to tubers. A lower specific leaf area (SLA) under WD, principally explained by decreases in new leaf production, number of leaves, and leaf size. This decrease might have had allowed a reduction in leaf transpiration, saving water for tuber bulking as suggested by Lahlou, et al. (2003). Payne et al. (1995) found that N uptake was linearly related to plant transpiration, and that about twice as much N is taken up per kg of transpiration in water-stressed plants than in non-water-stressed plants. Hence, potato genotypes with the ability to maintain low SPAD and high SLA under WD conditions, can maintain higher wue<sub>t</sub> and increase the tuber production. SPAD is an indicator of the photosynthetically active light transmittance characteristics of the leaf, which is dependent on the unit amount of chlorophyll per unit leaf area. SPAD units have been correlated with chlorophyll and carotenoid content in potato and other crops (Ramírez et al. 2014: Marenco et al. 2009) and are used in selecting genotypes tolerant to drought in breeding programs.</p>
<p>The genotypes like CIP398201.510 and CIP398203.244 with the longest roots showed the lowest yield and hi under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. In this genotype, the long roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than yield components.We found root dry weight, spad and hi to be good indicators for tuber water use efficient and useful traits for drought tolerance breeding programs Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.3</a>. The genotypes like CIP398201.510 and CIP398203.244 with the longest roots showed the lowest yield and hi under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. In this genotype, the long roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than yield components.</p>
<p>High correlation between tdw with wue<sub>t</sub> and hi than wue<sub>b</sub> indicates direct association between them, and at the same time, reflected the conservative relationship between biomass production and wue<sub>b</sub> through a range of limited soil water availability. We found root dry weight, spad and hi to be good indicators for tuber water use efficient and useful traits for drought tolerance breeding programs, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.3</a>. SPAD measurements of the leaf were used as an indicator of nitrogen status and leaf senescence. Passioura (1977) proposed that cereals for water-limited environments be developed with roots with restricted water uptake rates. Again, such an alteration would, in principle, conserve water during vegetative growth leaving more soil water for extraction during grain development. The key aspect of both strategies is that sustained reproductive growth is essential for a high harvest index. However, a deeper and more extensive rooting system may have drawbacks. A greater root biomass would almost surely result in lowered harvest index.</p>
<p>Evans (1980) suggested that one of the main variables for yield increases seen to date has been increases in harvest index. Harvest index (hi) and has been found to be relatively stable for a particular cultivar over wide range of conditions (Donald and Hamblin 1976). Passioura (1977) and Fischer (1979) have argued that obtaining high harvest indexes underwater-limited conditions is especially important obtaining high water-use efficiencies even if many crops it appears that further substantial improvements in harvest index are unlikely [Evans (1980)].</p>

<p>At all growth stages, water stress reduces photosynthetic efficiency, but drought during tuber initiation and bulking has the most drastic effect on yield (Yuan et al., 2003; Onder et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that reduced soil water availability at diff erent growth stages results in earlier crop maturity (Karafyllidis et al., 1996) and decreased plant growth, tuber yield, tubers per plant and tuber size and quality (Lynch et al., 1995; Dalla Costa et al., 1997; Yuan et al., 2003).</p>
<p>The 80% treatment was more efficient or equally efficient compared with the 100 and 120% treatments, and had higher WUE in the first year; thus, this level of irrigation can be recommended as a good strategy in situations with limited water supplies or high water costs. The 80% treatment was more efficient or equally efficient compared with the 100 and 120% treatments, and had higher WUE in the first year; thus, this level of irrigation can be recommended as a good strategy in situations with limited water supplies or high water costs <span class="citation">(Camargo et al., <a href="references.html#ref-camargo2015Potato" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The leaf chlorophyll content was lower in the high-WUE group indicating that the higher net photosynthesis rate was not due to higher leaf-N status <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The leaf chlorophyll content was lower in the high-WUE group indicating that the higher net photosynthesis rate was not due to higher leaf-N status <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Agriculture accounts for around 85 % of global water consumption (Shiklomanov and Rodda 2003), and the amount of water used for crop irrigation is predicted to double by 2050 (Tilman et al. 2002).</p>
<p>It is therefore essential for future studies to focus, in addition to improving the agricultural irrigation systems, on breeding crops with increased water-use efficiency (WUE), also at well-watered conditions <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The regulation of potato (Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum) stomatal conductance has been of special interest, as this crop is sensitive to drought and closes its stomata at relatively mild soil moisture deficits (Lynch et al. 1995, Sadras and Milroy 1996, Porter et al. 1999, Onder et al. 2005) resulting in considerable yield loss (Porter et al. 1999). An appropriate irrigation is therefore necessary to achieve desirable yield and quality (Liu et al. 2006). It has been shown that partial root zone drying (PRD), a technique where water is supplied alternately to two spatially separated parts of the potatoes root system, saves 30 % of irrigation water without reducing the overall yield (Shahnazariet al. 2007).</p>
<p>(ABA) based root-to-shoot chemical signalling system has been found to be effective in increasing WUE by partial stomatal closure, where water losses due to transpiration decrease significantly yet not affecting the photosynthetic potential of potato (Liu et al. 2005, 2006).</p>
<p>Potatoes use water more efficiently than cereals. The potato harvest index is approximately 0.75 and can reach as high as 0.86 (Shahnazari et al. 2007), in contrast to cereals for which it oscillates around 0.5 (Vreugdenhil and Bradshaw 2007).</p>
<p>Breeding potato with increased WUE is essential to meet the demand of a continuously increasing world population with little possibility to include previously unexploited arable land. However, phenotyping WUE is not a simple process due to cost, space and labour requirements <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The physiological mechanisms of potato plants response to various environmental conditions require deeper understanding. In addition, potato is an autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) and suffers from acute inbreeding depression (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium 2011), which contributes to a significant barrier for traditional breeding approaches <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Rolando et al., <a href="references.html#ref-rolando2015Leaf" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>{</p>
<p>However, in the three genotypes tested, an increase in greenness was noted one week after the initiation of water restriction and maintained for 4–6 weeks.</p>
<p>In our work, a decrease in leaf growth a week after the initiation of water restriction coincided with the leaf greenness increase. Reduced leaf growth under water restriction was evidenced by both reduced leaf length and total above ground biomass accumulation, the latter measured three weeks after the restriction started.</p>
<p>Unica had the highest DSI, its final TB under water restriction was higher than Désirée. DSI compares the ratio between TB under water restricted and control treatments, thus Unica higher DSI is the result of a much higher TB under control treatment than Désirée. This higher TB, among other reasons, is a result of a longer vegetative period during which the crop accumulated biomass (Tardieu, 2013).</p>
<p>Finally, as the increase of greenness promoted by water stress likely depends on the stage of application and intensity of water restriction, further research on the timing effect of drought stress on the senescence process and its impact on the photosynthetic apparatus should be considered.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Drought stress reduce the harvest index in 11% for WD plants, similar results were found in potato <em>(Schafleitner et al., 2007)</em> with 14% under terminal drought and more drastic with 57% Jerusalem artichoke <span class="citation">(Ruttanaprasert et al., <a href="references.html#ref-ruttanaprasert2016Effects" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> showing that potato have moderate reduction under drought stress including in the present study that the number of tuber did not have variation between treatments.</p>
<p><em>Jefferies (1992)</em> found that long term drought stress increased harvest index of potato in some early maturity varieties (from 0.41 to 0.50) but reduced one late maturity variety (from 0.54 to 0.25).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, harvest index of a tuber crop is an important trait determining yield under drought conditions <em>(Deguchi et al., 2010)</em>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Saravia et al., <a href="references.html#ref-saravia2016Yield" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>{</p>
<p>UNICA was the most efficient genotype at using the N present in the soil and tolerating drought stress, while Achirana-INTA was most affected by drought in terms of NUE.</p>
<p>Both UNICA and CIP397077.16 tolerated drought in terms of yield maintenance and used the N present in the soil more efficiently, also under drought, than Achirana-INTA.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Saravia et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-saravia2016Yield" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> show that UNICA and CIP397077.16 while they did not have difference for harvest index under well water and drought treatment the Chl<sub>spad</sub> can discriminate the relation between the tuber yield under drought stress with less Chl<sub>spad</sub> shown that Chl<sub>spad</sub> could allow to discriminate drought tolerance genotypes under field conditions.</p>
