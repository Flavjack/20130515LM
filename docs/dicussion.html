<p>Water stress triggered a range of morphological and physiological mechanisms in the potato genotypes tested, leading to different yield penalties and indicating a variety of survival strategies by potato. Most characteristics measure showed differences between treatments, pointing to their value in evaluating the impact of drought. Under WW conditions, soil can supply water at a steady rate to meet the transpiration demand. However, as the soil becomes dry, water flux from soil to root surface decreases and cannot satisfy the demand of transpiration. Additionally, in WD conditions, mineralization and supply of nutrients, especially N, is reduced, forcing the plant to use their resources efficiently as the only solution to not compromise yield (Motalebifard et al. 2013). According to (Songsri et al. 2009), enhanced extraction of water and nutrients from the soil due to large root system and long roots is a drought resistance mechanism in potato. But in our study showed that the minimal yield losses in some genotypes like CIP398190.89 under WD could be related to its ability to increase its wue<sub>t</sub>, by absorbing the limited water and nutrients available in the soil without changing have a high reduction in the final yield, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.3</a>.</p>
<p>Plant biomass accumulation, and consequently yield, was shown to be inextricably linked to transpiration <span class="citation">(Sinclair et al., <a href="references.html#ref-sinclair1984WaterUse" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>. A drought resistance mechanism can be the reduction of transpiration achieved by the reduction of leaf area with thick leaves often have greater photosynthetic capacity than thin leaves, due to their higher chlorophyll per leaf area counts (Songsri et al. 2009). Sensitive genotypes such as CIP398203.244 and CIP398201.510 preferred to produce leaves and more roots in preference to tubers. A lower specific leaf area (SLA) under WD, principally explained by decreases in new leaf production, number of leaves, and leaf size. This decrease might have had allowed a reduction in leaf transpiration, saving water for tuber bulking as suggested by Lahlou, et al. (2003). Payne et al. (1995) found that N uptake was linearly related to plant transpiration, and that about twice as much N is taken up per kg of transpiration in water-stressed plants than in non-water-stressed plants. Hence, potato genotypes with the ability to maintain low SPAD and high SLA under WD conditions, can maintain higher wue<sub>t</sub> and increase the tuber production. SPAD is an indicator of the photosynthetically active light transmittance characteristics of the leaf, which is dependent on the unit amount of chlorophyll per unit leaf area. SPAD units have been correlated with chlorophyll and carotenoid content in potato and other crops (Ramírez et al. 2014: Marenco et al. 2009) and are used in selecting genotypes tolerant to drought in breeding programs.</p>
<p>The genotypes like CIP398201.510 and CIP398203.244 with the longest roots showed the lowest yield and hi under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. In this genotype, the long roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than yield components.We found root dry weight, spad and hi to be good indicators for tuber water use efficient and useful traits for drought tolerance breeding programs Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.3</a>. The genotypes like CIP398201.510 and CIP398203.244 with the longest roots showed the lowest yield and hi under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. In this genotype, the long roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than yield components.</p>
<p>High correlation between tdw with wue<sub>t</sub> and hi than wue<sub>b</sub> indicates direct association between them, and at the same time, reflected the conservative relationship between biomass production and wue<sub>b</sub> through a range of limited soil water availability. We found root dry weight, spad and hi to be good indicators for tuber water use efficient and useful traits for drought tolerance breeding programs, Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:mva">7.3</a>. SPAD measurements of the leaf were used as an indicator of nitrogen status and leaf senescence. Passioura (1977) proposed that cereals for water-limited environments be developed with roots with restricted water uptake rates. Again, such an alteration would, in principle, conserve water during vegetative growth leaving more soil water for extraction during grain development. The key aspect of both strategies is that sustained reproductive growth is essential for a high harvest index. However, a deeper and more extensive rooting system may have drawbacks. A greater root biomass would almost surely result in lowered harvest index.</p>
<p>Evans (1980) suggested that one of the main variables for yield increases seen to date has been increases in harvest index. Harvest index (hi) and has been found to be relatively stable for a particular cultivar over wide range of conditions (Donald and Hamblin 1976). Passioura (1977) and Fischer (1979) have argued that obtaining high harvest indexes underwater-limited conditions is especially important obtaining high water-use efficiencies even if many crops it appears that further substantial improvements in harvest index are unlikely [Evans (1980)].</p>

<p>At all growth stages, water stress reduces photosynthetic efficiency, but drought during tuber initiation and bulking has the most drastic effect on yield (Yuan et al., 2003; Onder et al., 2005).</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that reduced soil water availability at diff erent growth stages results in earlier crop maturity (Karafyllidis et al., 1996) and decreased plant growth, tuber yield, tubers per plant and tuber size and quality (Lynch et al., 1995; Dalla Costa et al., 1997; Yuan et al., 2003).</p>
<p>The 80% treatment was more efficient or equally efficient compared with the 100 and 120% treatments, and had higher WUE in the first year; thus, this level of irrigation can be recommended as a good strategy in situations with limited water supplies or high water costs. The 80% treatment was more efficient or equally efficient compared with the 100 and 120% treatments, and had higher WUE in the first year; thus, this level of irrigation can be recommended as a good strategy in situations with limited water supplies or high water costs <span class="citation">(Camargo et al., <a href="references.html#ref-camargo2015Potato" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The leaf chlorophyll content was lower in the high-WUE group indicating that the higher net photosynthesis rate was not due to higher leaf-N status <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The leaf chlorophyll content was lower in the high-WUE group indicating that the higher net photosynthesis rate was not due to higher leaf-N status <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Agriculture accounts for around 85 % of global water consumption (Shiklomanov and Rodda 2003), and the amount of water used for crop irrigation is predicted to double by 2050 (Tilman et al. 2002).</p>
<p>It is therefore essential for future studies to focus, in addition to improving the agricultural irrigation systems, on breeding crops with increased water-use efficiency (WUE), also at well-watered conditions <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The regulation of potato (Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum) stomatal conductance has been of special interest, as this crop is sensitive to drought and closes its stomata at relatively mild soil moisture deficits (Lynch et al. 1995, Sadras and Milroy 1996, Porter et al. 1999, Onder et al. 2005) resulting in considerable yield loss (Porter et al. 1999). An appropriate irrigation is therefore necessary to achieve desirable yield and quality (Liu et al. 2006). It has been shown that partial root zone drying (PRD), a technique where water is supplied alternately to two spatially separated parts of the potatoes root system, saves 30 % of irrigation water without reducing the overall yield (Shahnazariet al. 2007).</p>
<p>(ABA) based root-to-shoot chemical signalling system has been found to be effective in increasing WUE by partial stomatal closure, where water losses due to transpiration decrease significantly yet not affecting the photosynthetic potential of potato (Liu et al. 2005, 2006).</p>
<p>Potatoes use water more efficiently than cereals. The potato harvest index is approximately 0.75 and can reach as high as 0.86 (Shahnazari et al. 2007), in contrast to cereals for which it oscillates around 0.5 (Vreugdenhil and Bradshaw 2007).</p>
<p>Breeding potato with increased WUE is essential to meet the demand of a continuously increasing world population with little possibility to include previously unexploited arable land. However, phenotyping WUE is not a simple process due to cost, space and labour requirements <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The physiological mechanisms of potato plants response to various environmental conditions require deeper understanding. In addition, potato is an autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) and suffers from acute inbreeding depression (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium 2011), which contributes to a significant barrier for traditional breeding approaches <span class="citation">(Kaminski et al., <a href="references.html#ref-kaminski2015Contrasting" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Rolando et al., <a href="references.html#ref-rolando2015Leaf" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>{</p>
<p>However, in the three genotypes tested, an increase in greenness was noted one week after the initiation of water restriction and maintained for 4–6 weeks.</p>
<p>In our work, a decrease in leaf growth a week after the initiation of water restriction coincided with the leaf greenness increase. Reduced leaf growth under water restriction was evidenced by both reduced leaf length and total above ground biomass accumulation, the latter measured three weeks after the restriction started.</p>
<p>Unica had the highest DSI, its final TB under water restriction was higher than Désirée. DSI compares the ratio between TB under water restricted and control treatments, thus Unica higher DSI is the result of a much higher TB under control treatment than Désirée. This higher TB, among other reasons, is a result of a longer vegetative period during which the crop accumulated biomass (Tardieu, 2013).</p>
<p>Finally, as the increase of greenness promoted by water stress likely depends on the stage of application and intensity of water restriction, further research on the timing effect of drought stress on the senescence process and its impact on the photosynthetic apparatus should be considered.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Drought stress reduce the harvest index in 11% for WD plants, similar results were found in potato <em>(Schafleitner et al., 2007)</em> with 14% under terminal drought and more drastic with 57% Jerusalem artichoke <span class="citation">(Ruttanaprasert et al., <a href="references.html#ref-ruttanaprasert2016Effects" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> showing that potato have moderate reduction under drought stress including in the present study that the number of tuber did not have variation between treatments.</p>
<p><em>Jefferies (1992)</em> found that long term drought stress increased harvest index of potato in some early maturity varieties (from 0.41 to 0.50) but reduced one late maturity variety (from 0.54 to 0.25).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, harvest index of a tuber crop is an important trait determining yield under drought conditions <em>(Deguchi et al., 2010)</em>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Saravia et al., <a href="references.html#ref-saravia2016Yield" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>{</p>
<p>UNICA was the most efficient genotype at using the N present in the soil and tolerating drought stress, while Achirana-INTA was most affected by drought in terms of NUE.</p>
<p>Both UNICA and CIP397077.16 tolerated drought in terms of yield maintenance and used the N present in the soil more efficiently, also under drought, than Achirana-INTA.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Saravia et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-saravia2016Yield" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span> show that UNICA and CIP397077.16 while they did not have difference for harvest index under well water and drought treatment the Chl<sub>spad</sub> can discriminate the relation between the tuber yield under drought stress with less Chl<sub>spad</sub> shown that Chl<sub>spad</sub> could allow to discriminate drought tolerance genotypes under field conditions.</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>A fast screening tool would be helpful in selecting valuable genotypes with defined growth strategies that translate to drought tolerance and are suitable for experiments and/or breeding <span class="citation">(Soltys-Kalina et al., <a href="references.html#ref-soltys-kalina2016effect" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Differentiation of the architecture of the potato root system were found in several potato cultivars in the field <span class="citation">(Zarzyńska et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zarzynska2017Differences" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>. but in our case root lengt and root dry weight have the no statistical differences. In our tent experiment, root growth of all cultivars was limited by the volume of plastic bags, in which plants were grown. Among tested potato cultivars no large differences in plant architecture or canopy size were observed <span class="citation">(Soltys-Kalina et al., <a href="references.html#ref-soltys-kalina2016effect" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The closure of stomata also reduces the rate of transpiration and results in the retention of water by the plant. Taken together, lowered rates of transpiration and photosynthesis directly affect water use efficiency (WUE) and drought tolerance (Chaerle, Saibo, &amp; van der Straeten, 2005).</p>
<p>From an agronomical point of view, maintaining yield levels during drought is crucial for breeders, and thus, the drought tolerance of cultivars has been quantified from tuber yield under irrigated and soil drought conditions <span class="citation">(Boguszewska-Mańkowska et al., <a href="references.html#ref-boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In the potato, yield is more affected by water deficiency during tuber formation than any other developmental stage (Ierna &amp; Mauromicale, 2012; Obidiegwu et al., 2015).</p>
<p>Among the earliest plant responses to soil water deficiency is stomatal closure protecting the plant against excessive loss of water but it concomitantly restricts CO2 gas exchange (Feller &amp; Vaseva, 2014; Obidiegwu et al., 2015).</p>
<p>A substantial increase in the efficiency of water use by Gwiazda was achieved by early stomata closure, and the sensitivity to ABA resulted in a significant reduction in transpiration rate.</p>
<p>The fluorescence quantum yield (Fv/Fm), the most widely used photosystem II efficiency indicator, did not change in tolerant potato cultivars (Gwiazda and Tajfun) under drought, but a small decrease in the Fv/ Fm ratio was associated with a lower drought tolerance in sensitive cultivars (Owacja and Oberon) <span class="citation">(Boguszewska-Mańkowska et al., <a href="references.html#ref-boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Potato genotypes did not show differences in Fv/Fm values even at relative water deficits below 40% (Tourneux, Devaux, Camacho, Mamani, &amp; Ledent, 2003) and during field drought, which were sufficient to lower the yield of tubers (Schafleitner et al., 2007). This indicates that photosystem II was unaffected by water deficiency, which implies that chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were unable to distinguish between drought-tolerant and -susceptible potato cultivars <span class="citation">(Boguszewska-Mańkowska et al., <a href="references.html#ref-boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Young leaves generally have the highest metabolic activity and presumably the highest photosynthetic capacity under drought as they are less affected by turgor losses than older ones. Hence, synthesis of drought-adaptive proteins such as dehydrins and heat shock proteins is preferentially maintained in younger leaves contributing to increasing total protein contents <span class="citation">(Meise et al., <a href="references.html#ref-meise2018Impact" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>High N contents in leaves were negatively correlated with RWC. Therefore, an excess of leaf N promoted turgor decline under drought emphasizing the importance of a well-balanced N fertilization under water limitation <span class="citation">(Meise et al., <a href="references.html#ref-meise2018Impact" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Saravia et al., <a href="references.html#ref-saravia2016Yield" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>breeding of potatoes with advanced drought tolerance by improvement of OA is considered doubtful. Other traits with relevance for drought tolerance as possibly proline accumulation and extended root systems appear more promising for improving drought tolerance in potatoes <span class="citation">(Meise et al., <a href="references.html#ref-meise2018Impact" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In potato plant, an optimal xylem-phloem transport interaction is critical considering the competition for photoassimilates between the above-ground and underground tissues (Kooman and Rabbinge 1996).</p>
<p>Drought conditions interfere with stem structure and availability of transport materials (Banik et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2009).</p>
<p>However, our fndings <span class="citation">(Aliche et al., <a href="references.html#ref-aliche2020Morphological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> support the hypothesis that stem growth reduction during dehydration may also serve an advantageous purpose for the plants—to reduce transport distance (Koch et al. 2004). This suggests that stem growth reduction under limited water availability can facilitate an efcient water and nutrient transport in plants.</p>
<p>The stomatal closure of source leaves under dehydration in our greenhouse study as was observed in Biogold and Hansa <span class="citation">(Aliche et al., <a href="references.html#ref-aliche2020Morphological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> may imply that the sink leaves needed to adapt carbon fxation rate, as was shown in another study where younger leaves maintained their stomatal conductance and photosynthesis despite the decline of these attributes in older leaves (Vos and Oyarzun 1987).</p>
<p>ABA signalling is induced by osmotic stress, and is also known to induce the expression of dehydrins (osmoprotectants), which function as chaperones in plant drought responses (Hanin et al., 2011). In our study, we observed that the expression of a dehydrin gene, TAS14, was upregulated under drought up to several hundred-folds <span class="citation">(Aliche et al., <a href="references.html#ref-aliche2020Morphological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In our study <span class="citation">(Aliche et al., <a href="references.html#ref-aliche2020Morphological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>, however, the chlorophyll fluorescence of drought-stressed plants did not significantly differ from those of the irrigated plants. Jefferies (1994) demonstrated in field grown potato (cv. Maris Piper) that drought had no significant effect on PSII function because excess light energy was dissipated by photorespiration.</p>
<p>The dark green-coloured drought-stressed leaves also had higher chlorophyll density <span class="citation">(Aliche et al., <a href="references.html#ref-aliche2020Morphological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Chlorophyll Content of Source leaves and Chlorophyll Content of Sink leaves have a positive relation with non-iirgated plant and negative relation with tuber dry weight <span class="citation">(Aliche et al., <a href="references.html#ref-aliche2020Morphological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. Chlorophyll Content could be interesting tool for screen drought tolerance genotypes.</p>
<p>Profiling of drought-resistance mechanisms and identification of drought-resistance genes are helpful ways to achieve this goal <span class="citation">(Chen et al., <a href="references.html#ref-chen2020Transcriptome" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Twenty-three drought-responsive genes were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive potato varieties under water stress <span class="citation">(Chen et al., <a href="references.html#ref-chen2020Transcriptome" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Some genes will have memory effect on stress in this process and will show higher expression level when drought occurs again <span class="citation">(Chen et al., <a href="references.html#ref-chen2020Transcriptome" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Diploid potato species have a wide genetic background, making it easier to isolate drought-resistant genes and analyze the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance, which can be as an effective material for drought resistance research in potato <span class="citation">(Khan et al., <a href="references.html#ref-khan2015Multiple" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>; Yang et al., <a href="references.html#ref-yang2019Transcriptome" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The decrease in the expression level of the photosynthesis-related genes of JSY under drought stress indicates that plant water deficiency inhibits photosynthesis, and the degree of decline is greater with the increase of plant dehydration <span class="citation">(Chen et al., <a href="references.html#ref-chen2020Transcriptome" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Transcript profiling highlighted a decrease in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins associated with PSII light harvesting complex in stress tolerant cultivars <span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Stress tolerant cultivars exhibited stronger expression of genes associated with plant growth and development, hormone metabolism and primary and secondary metabolism than stress susceptible cultivars <span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span></p>
<p>single and multiple abiotic stress tolerance in potato is associated with a maintenance of CO2 assimilation and protection of PSII by a reduction of light harvesting capacity.he data further suggests that stress tolerant cultivars suppress cell death and maintain growth and development via fine tuning of hormone signaling, and primary and secondary metabolism <span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is one of the most important food crops in the world where it ranks only behind rice and wheat in terms of global production (Birch et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Tuber yield under limited water conditions is influenced by a combination of morphological and physiological processes including, photosynthesis, leaf expansion, and senescence, assimilate partitioning, tuber initiation, and tuber bulking (van Loon, 1981).</p>
<p>One of the major causes of damage and subsequent reduction in yield of agricultural crops resulting from abiotic stress is the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (You and Chan, 2015).</p>
<p>There is therefore a clear need to understand the responses to combined abiotic stresses under real-world conditions, to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which crops can maintain yield and quality in the face of abiotic stress and to define markers that can be efficiently applied in breeding to generate potato varieties that are more tolerant to combined abiotic stress <span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Desiree and Unica (heat tolerant) both exhibited a significant reduction in the abundance of transcripts associated with PSII, particularly transcripts encoding light harvesting chlorophyllprotein complex components, when exposed to drought and heat <span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span></p>
<p><span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> These data suggest that tolerant cultivars acclimate to stress by reducing their light harvesting capacity thereby minimizing the potential for cellular damage resulting from the production of excessive ROS in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Similarly, only the stress tolerant genotypes exhibited an elevated leaf temperature under heat and drought stress in comparison with heat alone. This would be consistent with the induction of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and the increased radiation of absorbed light energy as heat (Ruban, 2016)</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> The transcription factor ABI5 is a key regulator of ABA signaling and stress responses and its function is modulated by AFP2 (Garcia et al., 2008). This provides a mechanism for fine-tuning stress responses and so its differential expression between heat tolerant and heat sensitive potato varieties is highly significant.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> We chose to impart stress treatments at the tuber initiation stage as this has been shown to limit foliage, stolon and tuber development and yield (Obidiegwu et al., 2015).</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> These experiments indicate that stress tolerant cultivars respond to stress by i) reducing light harvesting capacity and increasing non-photochemical quenching and ii) maintaining capacity for growth and development in part by iii) rerouting metabolism to compensate for reduced photosynthesis. This is achieved by a fine tuning of hormonal signaling. The responses of cultivars with contrasting abiotic stress tolerance provided information on genes/classes of compounds that may be used as targets for future studies aimed at enhancing multi-stress tolerance in potato.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Li et al., <a href="references.html#ref-li2020Enhanced" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> The transgenic potato plants showed normal phenotypes under drought stress, while the non-transgenic plants appeared withered. Results of physiological parameters assays showed that malondialdehyde, relative water content, and chlorophyll content in the transgenic potato plants were higher than that of non-transgenic plants. Upon rehydration after two weeks of drought, proline and soluble sugar contents of the transgenic potato plants were significantly higher than those of non-transgenic plants. These results combined demonstrate that the StProDH1 is a key player in the process of potato response to drought stress.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Li et al., <a href="references.html#ref-li2020Enhanced" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> we cloned two potato ProDH genes StProDH1 and StProDH2 from the potato cultivar ‘Favorita’, and silencing the StProDH1 gene by the amiRNA technology. Our results suggested that the proline content increased in the transgenic potato plants and was companied by an enhanced tolerance to drought. This result expands our understanding of the role of ProDH in potato.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Li et al., <a href="references.html#ref-li2020Enhanced" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> proline to be a compatible osmolyte, carbon, nitrogen storage, and ROS scavenger (Hare and Cress. 1997). In addition, proline accumulation may be involved in stress signaling response (Smirnoff and Cumbes. 1989). ProDH is a rate litmiting enzyme in proline catabolism, and is found a universally enzyme in all kingdoms of life (Servet et al., 2012).</p>
<p>A previous study reported that chlorophyll was a useful factor for assessing environmental stress resistance (Gao et al., 2015).</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Li et al., <a href="references.html#ref-li2020Enhanced" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> the transgenic potato plants with improved drought tolerance were successfully generated by silencing the StProDH1 gene. The transgenic plants showed enhanced proline and soluble sugar content, photosynthesis efficiency and membrane stability under drought stress.</p>
<p>Potato is the most important non-cereal food crop worldwide (Pino et al., 2010)</p>
<p>Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third most important crop species worldwide after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption, and its global production exceeds 388 million metric tons per year (Deuvax et al. 2014, FAOSTAT 2019)</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Plich et al., <a href="references.html#ref-plich2020Relations" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> It is well known that photosynthetic activity is reduced when plants are exposed to environmental stress (Retuerto et al. 2006; Prinzenberg et al. 2018). Drought stress reduces plant growth by reducing photosynthesis, which is mainly caused by stomatal limitation. Decreases in stomatal conductance reduce water loss through transpiration, but it also decreases carbon dioxide uptake, reducing the production of photoassimilates and plant growth.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Plich et al., <a href="references.html#ref-plich2020Relations" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> These results suggest that measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence may serve as a useful tool for estimating the level of tolerance to drought stress in potato.</p>
<p>With the change in environment and the scarcity of resources, abiotic stress has become an important factor which restricts the growing development of plants, having serious impact on quality of the agricultural products (Thao and Tran, 2012).</p>
<p>Drought is one of the most uncontrollable and pervasive factors (Obidiegwu et al., 2015).</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Qi et al., <a href="references.html#ref-qi2020potato" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> In this study, it found that the StRFP2 gene was significantly up-regulated during drought stress which shows similar result as in previous transcriptome studies in potato under drought stress.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Reddy et al., <a href="references.html#ref-reddy2020Leaf" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> Increased water use efficiency (WUE) by virtue of higher carbon assimilatory capacity can significantly circumvent this trade-off. Here, we report leaf mass area (LMA) has an important canopy architecture trait which when combined with superior carboxylation efficiency (CE) would achieve higher water productivity in rice.</p>
<p><span class="citation">(Reddy et al., <a href="references.html#ref-reddy2020Leaf" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> Increased WUE through improved chloroplast capacity to fix carbon has a greater relevance in enhancing water productivity in rice.</p>
