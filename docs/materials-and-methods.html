<p>Two commercial varieties and thirteen potato genotypes were selected from the advanced breeding population collection of the International Potato Center (CIP) (Table <a href="tables.html#tab:gnt">7.1</a>). The commercial varieties were, UNICA (CIP392797.22) with a good response to warm and dry environments <span class="citation">(Demirel et al., <a href="references.html#ref-demirel2020Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; Guti√©rrez-Rosales et al., <a href="references.html#ref-gutierrez-rosales2007UNICA" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>; Rolando et al., <a href="references.html#ref-rolando2015Leaf" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>; and Achirana INTA (CIP720088) known for their earliness and drought tolerance <span class="citation">(Schafleitner et al., <a href="references.html#ref-schafleitner2007Field" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="experimental-conditions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Experimental conditions</h2>
<p>The experiment was carried out in complete randomize block design where the first factor was the two irrigation treatments: well-watered (WW) and water deficit (WD). The second factor were the fifteen potato genotypes (Table <a href="tables.html#tab:gnt">7.1</a>). Each treatment consisted of five replicates with one potato plant for each experimental unit.</p>
</div>
<div id="cultivation-and-management" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Cultivation and management</h2>
<p>The experiment was conducted at the International Potato Center (CIP) experimental station in Lima, Peru (12.1‚ó¶ S, 77.0‚ó¶ W, 244 m.a.s.l.). The plants were grown in an environmentally controlled greenhouse at 28/15¬∞C day/night with 70¬±5% average relative humidity (HOBO U12 Outdoor/Industrial model, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA). Single plants were grown in a greenhouse in 5 L plastic pots and containing 5 kg of dry commercial Sogemix SM2 (75% Peat Moss, perlite, vermiculite and limestone). The potato tubers were pre-sprouted for 2 weeks in dark chamber and planted after in pots at 5‚Äì7 cm depth. Fertilization was done each pot twice. The first one at planting, 10 g of a mixture of granular fertilizers was mixed with the substrate. Fertilizer mixture was composed of CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (urea; 46% N), KCl (potassium chloride; 60% K<sub>2</sub>O) and (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> (diammonium phosphate, 18% N and 46% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) in a ratio of 2:1:2, respectively. The second fertilization was done 40 days after planting (dap) with 5 g of urea, before the starting of the treatment.</p>
</div>
<div id="dry-down-methodology" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Dry down methodology</h2>
<p>Two irrigation treatments were applied: well-watered (WW) treatment where plants were irrigated according to their transpiration demand (Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:srl">7.1</a>B); and water deficit (WD) treatment with gradual reduction of water supply until wilting point. At 35 dap, prior to the stress initiation, the pots from both WW and WD treatments were watered to soaking and then allowed to drain overnight. Next morning, the pots were sealed in a plastic bag secured with a twist tie to prevent water loss except by transpiration. Thereafter, all the pots were weighed and this weight was defined as the initial pot weight. The inter-daily weight of the pots was carried out for 10 day for calculate the initial dry down parameters for treatment application (Figure <a href="figures.html#fig:srl">7.1</a>A). Water deficit treatment were imposed at 45 dap that coincides with the beginning of the development of the stolons. In order to expose plants under water deficit, WD treatment were reduced 150 mL of water in each irrigation.</p>
</div>
<div id="transpiration-rate-and-soil-water-supply" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Transpiration rate and soil water supply</h2>
<p>Transpiration was calculated by weighing the pots every two days between 13:00 and 15:00 hours (GMT -05:00). The transpiration of each plant was calculated by the procedure previously described by <span class="citation">Bhatnagar-Mathur et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bhatnagar-mathur2007Stressinducible" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Ray &amp; Sinclair (<a href="references.html#ref-ray1998effect" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>. The inter-daily transpiration rates of WD plants were normalized against WW plant rates to reduce the influence of day-to-day variation, as follow, <span class="math inline">\(TRS=\left(\frac{WD_{transpiration}}{WW_{transpiration\ average}}\right)\)</span>. The normalization was achieved by dividing transpiration of each individual plant in the WD regime by the mean transpiration of the WW plants. For compare the transpiration between plants, a second normalization was done so that the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) of each plant was defined in 1.0 when the soil water content in each pot was at field capacity <span class="citation">(Sinclair &amp; Ludlow, <a href="references.html#ref-sinclair1986Influence" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span>. The available soil water or the fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw), for each pot was calculated by dividing the pot weight minus the final pot weight by the transpirable soil water of that pot, using the following formula, <span class="math inline">\(FTSW=\left(\frac{pot\ weight_{inter-daily}-pot\ weight_{final}}{pot\ weight_{initial}-pot\ weight_{final}}\right)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="evaluated-traits" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.6</span> Evaluated traits</h2>
<p><strong>Water use efficiency (wue).</strong> is defined as a ratio of biomass accumulation, total crop biomass or crop grain yield, to water consumed, expressed as transpiration, evapotranspiration, or total water input to the system <span class="citation">(Sinclair et al., <a href="references.html#ref-sinclair1984WaterUse" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>. According to this concept we calculated the biomass water use efficiency (wue<sub>b</sub>) and tuber water use efficiency (wue<sub>t</sub>). The wue<sub>b</sub> was calculated as the total biomass in dry weight produced divided by the cumulative water transpired <span class="citation">(Dalla Costa et al., <a href="references.html#ref-dallacosta1997Yield" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> and for wue<sub>t</sub> we used the dry weight from tuber production divide by the total water transpired (trs; mL) during the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Relative water content (rwc).</strong> was determined by weighing the third leaflet in fresh weight (FW) from the third leaf from the apical part from the youngest fully expanded leaf of each plant. Each leaflet was placed in a 4x3 inch Ziploc bag containing distilled water for 24 hours and after this time it was removed to taking turgid weight (TW) afterwards it was dried in an oven at 90¬∫C for 24 hours and weighed (DW). The rwc was calculated according to <span class="citation">Vasquez-Robinet et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-vasquez-robinet2008Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> by the formula, <span class="math inline">\(RWC\left(\%\right)=\left(\frac{leaflet_{FW}-leaflet_{DW}}{leaflet_{TW}-leaflet_{DW}}\right)\cdot100\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Leaf osmotic potential (lop).</strong> was determined using a dew point microvoltmeter (HR-33T Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with leaf discs of 5 mm diameter, taken from the third fully extended leaf. The leaf discs were put in 1 ml cryogenic tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. The frozen leaves were incubated at 22¬∞C for 30 min in a sealed C-52 chamber (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA).</p>
<p><strong>Chlorophyll concentration (spad).</strong> The chlorophyll content of the plant was evaluated in three points (upper, middle and lower leaflet of a leaf) of the third youngest fully expanded leaf. Measurements to obtain the relative concentration of chlorophyll molecules per unit area of the leaf surface <span class="citation">(Ling et al., <a href="references.html#ref-ling2011Use" role="doc-biblioref">2011</a>)</span> were taken with a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan). Individual readings of leaflets were averaged to represent individual measurement of a leaf. The evaluations were done on light adapted leaves at 29, 59, 76, and 83 day after planting (dap).</p>
<p><strong>Post-harvest traits.</strong> The harvest was at 90 dap and the plants were separated in four components: leaves, stems, roots and tubers. The dry weight (g) components were determined by drying them at 80¬∞C for 3 days in a forced air oven: leaf (ldw), stem (sdw), root (rdw), tuber (tdw). The leaf area (lfa; cm<sup>2</sup>) in each plants was measured by taking photographs of all the leaves arranged on a wooden board and analyzing them using ImageJ software <span class="citation">(Rueden et al., <a href="references.html#ref-rueden2017ImageJ2" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>; Z√°rate-Salazar et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zarate-salazar2018Comparacao" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Indices.</strong> The harvest index (hi) was calculated as the ratio of tdw related to the total dry biomass (tdb; g) and specific leaf area (sla) was calculated by dividing the leaf area (lfa) with lead dry weight (ldw). The relative chlorophyll content (rcc) were calculated with the relation between spad at 83 dap (spad_83) and leaf area (lfa) multiplied by 100 for better scale interpretation.</p>
