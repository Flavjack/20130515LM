<p>Thirteen potato clones were selected from advanced breeding population collection at International Potato Center (CIP) and two commercial varieties, Table (<a href="tables.html#tab:gnt">7.1</a>). UNICA (CIP392797.22) and Achirana INTA (CIP720088) known for their earliness and drought tolerance <em>(Schafleitner et al. 2007)</em>. UNICA has a good response to warm and dry environments <em>(Gutiérrez et al., 2007)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="experimental-design-and-conditions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Experimental design and conditions</h2>
<p>The experiment was carried out in complete randomize block design where the first factor was the two irrigation treatments: well-watered (WW), treatment where the moisture was maintained at field capacity and water deficit (WD) and the second factor were compound by the fifteen potato genotypes, Table (<a href="tables.html#tab:gnt">7.1</a>). Each treatment consisted of five replicates with one potato plant for each experimental unit.</p>
</div>
<div id="cultivation-and-management" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Cultivation and management</h2>
<p>The experiment was conducted at the International Potato Center (CIP) experimental station in Lima, Peru (12.1◦ S, 77.0◦ W, 244 m.a.s.l.). The plants were grown in an environmentally controlled greenhouse at 28/15°C day/night with 70±5% average relative humidity (HOBO U12 Outdoor/Industrial model, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA). Single plants were grown in a greenhouse in 5 liters plastic pots and It was sown containing 5 kg of dry commercial Sogemix SM2 (75% Peat Moss, perlite, vermiculite, and limestone). The potato tubers were pre-sprouted for 2 weeks and
planted at 5–7 cm depth. Fertilization was done twice with ammonium nitrate; triple superphosphate and potassium sulphate, one before planting mixed with the substrate and the other applied at the surface at 40 days after planting (dap).</p>

<div id="transpiration-rate-and-soil-water-supply" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Transpiration rate and soil water supply</h2>
<p>The pots from both well water (WW) and water deficit (WD) treatments were watered to soaking and then allowed to drain overnight. Next day, soil evaporation was minimized by sealed with a plastic bag and all the pots were weighed and it was defined as the initial pot weight. Water deficits were imposed at 45 dap that coincides with the beginning of the development of the stolons.</p>
<p>Transpiration was calculated by weighing the pots every two days in the between 13:00 and 15:00 hours (GMT -05:00). The transpiration of each plant was calculated by the procedure previously described by <span class="citation">Bhatnagar-Mathur et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-bhatnagar-mathur2007Stressinducible" role="doc-biblioref">2007</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Ray &amp; Sinclair (<a href="references.html#ref-ray1998effect" role="doc-biblioref">1998</a>)</span>. The inter-daily transpiration rates of WD plants were normalized against WW plant rates to reduce the influence of day-to-day variation (<span class="math inline">\(TRS=\left(\frac{WD_{transpiration}}{WW_{transpiration\ average}}\right)\)</span>). The normalization was achieved by dividing transpiration of each individual plant in the WD regime by the mean transpiration of the WW plants. For compare the transpiration between plants, a second normalization was done so that the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) of each plant was defined in 1.0 when the soil water content in each pot was at field capacity <span class="citation">(Sinclair &amp; Ludlow, <a href="references.html#ref-sinclair1986Influence" role="doc-biblioref">1986</a>)</span>. The available soil water or the fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw), for each pot was calculated by dividing the pot weight minus the final pot weight by the transpirable soil water of that pot (<span class="math inline">\(FTSW=\left(\frac{pot\ weight_{inter-daily}-pot\ weight_{final}}{pot\ weight_{initial}-pot\ weight_{final}}\right)\)</span>).</p>

<div id="evaluated-traits" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> Evaluated traits</h2>
<p><strong>Water use efficiency (wue).</strong> is defined as a ratio of biomass accumulation, total crop biomass or crop grain yield, to water consumed, expressed as transpiration, evapo transpiration, or total water input to the system <span class="citation">(Sinclair et al., <a href="references.html#ref-sinclair1984WaterUse" role="doc-biblioref">1984</a>)</span>. According to this concept we calculated the biomass water use efficiency (wue) and tuber water use efficiency (twue). The wue was calculated as the total biomass in dry weight produced divided by the cumulative water transpired <span class="citation">(Dalla Costa et al., <a href="references.html#ref-dallacosta1997Yield" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> and for twue was used the dry weight from tuber production divide the cumulative water transpired (trs) during the treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Relative water content (rwc).</strong> was determined by weighing the third leaflet (FW) from the third leaf from the apical part from the youngest fully expanded leaf of each plant. Each leaflet were placing in a 4x3 inch ziploc bag containing distilled water for 24 hours and after these time it was removed to taking turgid weight (TW) afterwards it was dried in an oven at 90 ºC for 24 hours and weighed (DW). The rwc was calculated according to <span class="citation">Vasquez-Robinet et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-vasquez-robinet2008Physiological" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> by the formula <span class="math inline">\(RWC\left(\%\right)=\left(\frac{leaflet_{FW}-leaflet_{DW}}{leaflet_{TW}-leaflet_{DW}}\right)\cdot100\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Leaf osmotic potential (lop).</strong> was determined using a dew point microvoltmeter (HR-33T Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with leaf discs of 5 mm diameter, taken from the third fully extended leaf. The leaf discs were put in 1 ml cryogenic tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. The frozen leaves were incubated at 22°C for 30 min in a sealed C-52 chamber (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA).</p>
<p><strong>Chlorophyll concentration (Chl<sub>spad</sub>).</strong> The chlorophyll content of the plant was evaluated by taking SPAD measurements using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan) from the third youngest fully expanded leaf from three points (upper, middle and lower leaflet of a leaf). Individual readings of leaflets were averaged to represent individual measurement of a leaf. The evaluations were done on light adapted leaves at 29, 59, 76, and 83 day after planting (dap). SPAD values were highly significantly correlated with a + b chlorophyll concentration per unit leaf area (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>g cm<sub>−2</sub>) as determined by <em>Lichtenthaler and Wellburn (1983)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Post-harvest traits.</strong> The harvest was at 90 dap. The plants were separated in four components: leaves, stems, roots and tubers. The dry weight (g) components were determined by drying them at 80°C for 3 days in a forced air oven: leaf (ldw), stem (sdw), root (rdw), tuber (tdw). The leaf area (lfa) of the plants was measured in cm<sup>2</sup> by taking photographs of all the leaves arranged on a wooden board and analyzing the pictures using ImageJ software <span class="citation">(Zárate-Salazar et al., <a href="references.html#ref-zarate-salazar2018Comparacao" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Indices.</strong> The harvest index (hi) was calculated as the ratio of tdw related to the total dry biomass (tdb) and specific leaf area (sla) was calculated by dividing the leaf area (lfa) with lead dry weight (ldw).</p>

<p>Statistical analysis and graphs were performed in the statistical software R <span class="citation">(R Core Team, <a href="references.html#ref-R-base" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the differences between the factors and the comparison of the means with the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p&lt;0.05) with agricoale and GerminaR package <span class="citation">(de Mendiburu, <a href="references.html#ref-R-agricolae" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>; Lozano-Isla et al., <a href="references.html#ref-lozano-isla2019GerminaR" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>.
