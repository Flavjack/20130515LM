# Conclusions

<!-- Based on our results, the genotypes with reduced SLA, longest root length and that maintain relatively high WUE under WD conditions, like CIP398201.510, are drought avoidant. Additionally, we found that tolerant genotypes like CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, and UNICA preferentially use available water for tuber production rather than above ground biomass (Figure 5b). Our study demonstrated that root length, SPAD and SLA are important traits related to WUE and could be useful as selection criteria of new genotypes. However, there are additional strategies of the below-ground plant parts that need to be explored for their role in yield stability under water stress conditions. -->
