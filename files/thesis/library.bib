@article{Peretz2007,
abstract = {A universal vector (IL-60 and auxiliary constructs), expressing or silencing genes in every plant tested to date, is described. Plants that have been successfully manipulated by the IL-60 system include hard-to-manipulate species such as wheat (Triticum duram), pepper (Capsicum annuum), grapevine (Vitis vinifera), citrus, and olive (Olea europaea). Expression or silencing develops within a few days in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), wheat, and most herbaceous plants and in up to 3 weeks in woody trees. Expression, as tested in tomato, is durable and persists throughout the life span of the plant. The vector is, in fact, a disarmed form of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, which is applied as a double-stranded DNA and replicates as such. However, the disarmed virus does not support rolling-circle replication, and therefore viral progeny single-stranded DNA is not produced. IL-60 does not integrate into the plant's genome, and the construct, including the expressed gene, is not heritable. IL-60 is not transmitted by the Tomato yellow leaf curl virus's natural insect vector. In addition, artificial satellites were constructed that require a helper virus for replication, movement, and expression. With IL-60 as the disarmed helper "virus," transactivation occurs, resulting in an inducible expressing/silencing system. The system's potential is demonstrated by IL-60-derived suppression of a viral-silencing suppressor of Grapevine virus A, resulting in Grapevine virus A-resistant/tolerant plants.},

abstract = {Two sampling methods (manual capture and live-baited adhesive traps) were compared for collecting the bug Rhodnius neglectus Lent (Hemiptera: Reduviidae: Triatominae) from palm trees, Mauritia flexuosa L. (Arecaceae), in the savanna of Bras\'{\i}lia DF. R. neglectus was found in 19/50 (38\%) of palm trees sampled. The detection rate was much higher by visual inspection and manual capture (18/50=36\%) than by our trapping method (5/50=10\%), although one tree was found to be positive by trapping but not by manual capture. Bugs collected manually were mostly (146/154=95\%) found among the dead organic material in palm crowns. In combination, these sampling techniques are useful for quick detection of triatomine bug infestation in palm trees, especially in areas of high ecological value where the palms should not be cut and dissected, but arboreal Rhodnius are suspected to transmit enzootic Trypanosoma cruzi that might represent a risk of causing human cases of Chagas disease.},

@article{Jensen2010,
abstract = {Agriculture is a big consumer of fresh water in competition with other sectors of the society. Within the EU-project SAFIR new water-saving irrigation strategies were developed based on pot, semi-field and field experiments with potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), fresh tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and processing tomatoes as model plants. From the pot and semi-field experiments an ABA production model was developed for potatoes to optimize the ABA signalling; this was obtained by modelling the optimal level of soil drying for ABA production before re-irrigation in a crop growth model. The field irrigation guidelines were developed under temperate (Denmark), Mediterranean (Greece, Italy) and continental (Serbia, China) climatic conditions during summer. The field investigations on processing tomatoes were undertaken only in the Po valley (North Italy) on fine, textured soil. The investigations from several studies showed that gradual soil drying imposed by deficit irrigation (DI) or partial root zone drying irrigation (PRD) induced hydraulic and chemical signals from the root system resulting in partial stomatal closure, an increase in photosynthetic water use efficiency, and a slight reduction in top vegetative growth. Further PRD increased N-mineralization significantly beyond that from DI, causing a stay-green effect late in the growing season. In field potato and tomato experiments the water-saving irrigation strategies DI and PRD were able to save about 20–30\% of the water used in fully irrigated plants. PRD increased marketable yield in potatoes significantly by 15\% due to improved tuber size distribution. PRD increased antioxidant content significantly by approximately 10\% in both potatoes and fresh tomatoes. Under a high temperature regime, full irrigation (FI) should be undertaken, as was clear from field observations in tomatoes. For tomatoes full irrigation should be undertaken for cooling effects when the night/day average temperature >26.5°C or when air temperature >40°C to avoid flower-dropping. The temperature threshold for potatoes is not clear. From three-year field drip irrigation experiments we found that under the establishment phase, both potatoes and tomatoes should be fully irrigated; however, during the later phases deficit irrigation might be applied as outlined below without causing significant yield reduction:•Potatoes∘After the end of tuber initiation, DI or PRD is applied at 70\% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50\% of FI.•Fresh tomatoes∘From the moment the 1st truce is developed, DI is applied at 85–80\% of FI for two weeks. In the middle period, DI or PRD is applied at 70\% of FI. During the last 14 days of the growth period, DI or PRD is applied at 50\% of FI.•Processing tomatoes∘From transplanting to fruit setting at 4th–5th cluster, the PRD and DI threshold for re-irrigation is when the plant-available soil water content (ASWC) equals 0.7 (soil water potential, $\Psi$soil=−90kPa). During the late fruit development/ripening stage, 10\% of red fruits, the threshold for re-irrigation for DI is when ASWC=0.5 ($\Psi$soil=−185kPa) and for PRD when ASWC (dry side)=0.4 ($\Psi$soil, dry side=−270kPa). The findings during the SAFIR project might be used as a framework for implementing water-saving deficit irrigation under different local soil and climatic conditions.},

abstract = {A rapid and reliable analytical method for quantification of flavonoids in onions was developed and validated. Five extraction methods were tested on freeze-dried onions and subsequently high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV detection was used for quantification of seven flavonoids. The extraction efficiencies were lowest for the conventional water bath extraction compared to pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), ultrasonication, ultrasonic liquid processor, and microwave extraction, which yielded similar efficiencies. The reproducibility was in the same range (RSD: 1-11\%) for all tested extraction methods. However, PLE was the preferred extraction method because the method can be highly automated, use only small amounts of solvents, provide the cleanest extracts, and allow the extraction of light and oxygen-sensitive flavonoids to be carried out in an inert atmosphere protected from light. The method parameters: extraction temperature, sample weight, flush volume and solvent type were optimised, and a clean-up step was integrated in the PLE procedure by in-cell addition of C18-material to the extraction cells, which slightly improved the recovery and reproducibility of the method. The one-step PLE method showed good selectivity, precision (RSDs=3.1-11\%) and recovery of the extractable flavonoids (98-99\%). The method also appeared to be a multi-method, i.e. generally applicable to, e.g. phenolic acids in potatoes and carrots.},

@article{Gawronska2013,
abstract = {In the halophytic plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum salinity or drought can change the mode of photosynthesis from C(3) to crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). These two stress factors are linked to oxidative stress, however, the induction of CAM by oxidative stress per se is not straightforward. Treatment with high light (HL) did not lead to the induction of CAM, as documented by a low night/day difference in malate level and a low expression of the CAM-related form of phosphoenolcarboxylase (Ppc1), despite causing some oxidative damage (elevated MDA level, malondialdehyde). In contrast to the action of high salinity (0.4M NaCl), HL treatment did not activate neither the cytosolic NADP-malic enzyme nor the chloroplastic form of NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH). In plastids of HL-treated plants a huge amount of starch was accumulated. This was associated with a weak stimulation of hydrolytic and phosphorolytic starch-degrading enzymes, in contrast to their strong up-regulation under high salinity. It is concluded that HL alone is not able to activate starch degradation necessary for CAM performance. Moreover, in the absence of salinity in C(3)M. crystallinum plants an age-dependent increase in energy dissipation from PSII was documented under high irradiance, as illustrated by non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Obtained data suggest that in this halophytic species several photoprotective strategies are strictly salinity-dependent.},

abstract = {The primary effect of the response of plants to rising atmospheric CO2 (Ca) is to increase resource use efficiency. Elevated Ca reduces stomatal conductance and transpiration and improves water use efficiency, and at the same time it stimulates higher rates of photosynthesis and increases light-use efficiency. Acclimation of photosynthesis during long-term exposure to elevated Ca reduces key enzymes of the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle, and this increases nutrient use efficiency. Improved soil-water balance, increased carbon uptake in the shade, greater carbon to nitrogen ratio, and reduced nutrient quality for insect and animal grazers are all possibilities that have been observed in field studies of the effects of elevated Ca. These effects have major consequences for agriculture and native ecosystems in a world of rising atmospheric Ca and climate change.},

abstract = {Effect of different photosynthetic photon flux densities (0, 500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1)), temperatures (20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 °C) and CO2 concentrations (250, 350, 450, 550, 650 and 750 $\mu$mol mol(-1)) on gas and water vapour exchange characteristics of Cannabis sativa L. were studied to determine the suitable and efficient environmental conditions for its indoor mass cultivation for pharmaceutical uses. The rate of photosynthesis (PN) and water use efficiency (WUE) of Cannabis sativa increased with photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD) at the lower temperatures (20-25 °C). At 30 °C, PN and WUE increased only up to 1500 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1) PPFD and decreased at higher light levels. The maximum rate of photosynthesis (PN max) was observed at 30 °C and under 1500 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1) PPFD. The rate of transpiration (E) responded positively to increased PPFD and temperature up to the highest levels tested (2000 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1) and 40 °C). Similar to E, leaf stomatal conductance (gs) also increased with PPFD irrespective of temperature. However, gs increased with temperature up to 30 °C only. Temperature above 30 °C had an adverse effect on gs in this species. Overall, high temperature and high PPFD showed an adverse effect on PN and WUE. A continuous decrease in intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) and therefore, in the ratio of intercellular CO2 to ambient CO2 concentration (Ci/Ca) was observed with the increase in temperature and PPFD. However, the decrease was less pronounced at light intensities above 1500 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1). In view of these results, temperature and light optima for photosynthesis was concluded to be at 25-30 °C and ∼1500 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1) respectively. Furthermore, plants were also exposed to different concentrations of CO2 (250, 350, 450, 550, 650 and 750 $\mu$mol mol(-1)) under optimum PPFD and temperature conditions to assess their photosynthetic response. Rate of photosynthesis, WUE and Ci decreased by 50 \%, 53 \% and 10 \% respectively, and Ci/Ca, E and gs increased by 25 \%, 7 \% and 3 \% respectively when measurements were made at 250 $\mu$mol mol-1 as compared to ambient CO2 (350 $\mu$mol mol(-1)) level. Elevated CO2 concentration (750 $\mu$mol mol(-1)) suppressed E and gs ∼ 29\% and 42\% respectively, and stimulated PN, WUE and Ci by 50 \%, 111 \% and 115 \% respectively as compared to ambient CO2 concentration. The study reveals that this species can be efficiently cultivated in the range of 25 to 30 °C and ∼1500 $\mu$mol m(-2)s(-1) PPFD. Furthermore, higher PN, WUE and nearly constant Ci/Ca ratio under elevated CO2 concentrations in C. sativa, reflects its potential for better survival, growth and productivity in drier and CO2 rich environment.},

@article{Kirschbaum2004,
abstract = {Climate change affects plants in many different ways. Increasing CO(2) concentration can increase photosynthetic rates. This is especially pronounced for C(3) plants, at high temperatures and under water-limited conditions. Increasing temperature also affects photosynthesis, but plants have a considerable ability to adapt to their growth conditions and can function even at extremely high temperatures, provided adequate water is available. Temperature optima differ between species and growth conditions, and are higher in elevated atmospheric CO(2). With increasing temperature, vapour pressure deficits of the air may increase, with a concomitant increase in the transpiration rate from plant canopies. However, if stomata close in response to increasing CO(2) concentration, or if there is a reduction in the diurnal temperature range, then transpiration rates may even decrease. Soil organic matter decomposition rates are likely to be stimulated by higher temperatures, so that nutrients can be more readily mineralised and made available to plants. This is likely to increase photosynthetic carbon gain in nutrient-limited systems. All the factors listed above interact strongly so that, for different combinations of increases in temperature and CO(2) concentration, and for systems in different climatic regions and primarily affected by water or nutrient limitations, photosynthesis must be expected to respond differently to the same climatic changes.},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that global crop production needs to double by 2050 to meet the projected demands from rising population, diet shifts, and increasing biofuels consumption. Boosting crop yields to meet these rising demands, rather than clearing more land for agriculture has been highlighted as a preferred solution to meet this goal. However, we first need to understand how crop yields are changing globally, and whether we are on track to double production by 2050. Using ∼2.5 million agricultural statistics, collected for ∼13,500 political units across the world, we track four key global crops-maize, rice, wheat, and soybean-that currently produce nearly two-thirds of global agricultural calories. We find that yields in these top four crops are increasing at 1.6\%, 1.0\%, 0.9\%, and 1.3\% per year, non-compounding rates, respectively, which is less than the 2.4\% per year rate required to double global production by 2050. At these rates global production in these crops would increase by ∼67\%, ∼42\%, ∼38\%, and ∼55\%, respectively, which is far below what is needed to meet projected demands in 2050. We present detailed maps to identify where rates must be increased to boost crop production and meet rising demands.},

abstract = {Various techniques for improving the resistance of plants to drought or salinity are discussed in relation to a notional spectrum ranging from rationality to random search. The rational end of the spectrum is exemplified by the control of phenology so that flowering occurs at an optimal time; the random end by wide crosses, such as that between wheat and <I>Elytrigia</I>, which give the remote hope that the high yield-potential of one will combine with the toughness of the other. Most of the techniques occupy the middle ground and involve selecting for characters whose protagonists have strong, but often poorly articulated, hunches that the characters will confer resistance to drought or salinity on the plants possessing them. For drought resistance of grain crops, the possible worth of many of these characters is discussed in relation to their likely impact on improving a crop's ability to (a) extract water from the soil, (b) produce dry matter given a limited water supply, and (c) convert dry matter into grain.},

abstract = {Individual leaves of potato (Solanum tuberosum L. W729R), a C(3) plant, were subjected to various irradiances (400-700 nm), CO(2) levels, and temperatures in a controlled-environment chamber. As irradiance increased, stomatal and mesophyll resistance exerted a strong and some-what paralleled regulation of photosynthesis as both showed a similar decrease reaching a minimum at about 85 neinsteins.cm(-2).sec(-1) (about (1/2) of full sunlight). Also, there was a proportional hyperbolic increase in transpiration and photosynthesis with increasing irradiance up to 85 neinsteins.cm(-2).sec(-1). These results contrast with many C(3) plants that have a near full opening of stomata at much less light than is required for saturation of photosynthesis.Inhibition of photosynthesis by 21\% O(2) was nearly overcome by a 2-fold increase in atmospheric levels of CO(2) (about 1,200 ng.cm(-3)). Photosynthesis at 25 C, high irradiance, 2.5\% O(2) and atmospheric levels of CO(2) was about 80\% of the CO(2)-saturated rate, suggesting that CO(2) can be rate-limiting even without O(2) inhibition of photosynthesis. With increasing CO(2) concentration, mesophyll resistance decreased slightly while stomatal resistance increased markedly above 550 ng.cm(-3) which resulted in a significant reduction in transpiration.Although potato is a very productive C(3) crop, there is substantial O(2) inhibition of photosynthesis. The level of O(2) inhibition was maximum around 25 C but the percentage inhibition of photosynthesis by O(2) increased steadily from 38\% at 16 C to 56\% at 36 C. Photosynthesis and transpiration showed broad temperature optima (16-25 C). At higher temperatures, both the increased percentage inhibition of photosynthesis by O(2) and the increased stomatal resistance limit photosynthesis, while increased stomatal resistance limits transpiration. Water use efficiency, when considered at a constant vapor pressure gradient, increased with increasing irradiance, CO(2) concentration, and temperature.},

abstract = {The in vivo photochemical activity of photosystem II was inferred from modulated chlorophyll fluorescence and photoacoustic measurements in intact leaves of several plant species (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., Solanum tuberosum L., Solanum nigrum L.) exposed to various environmental stresses (drought, heat, strong light) applied separately or in combination. Photosystem II was shown to be highly drought-resistant: even a drastic desiccation in air of detached leaf samples only marginally affected the quantum yield for photochemistry in photosystem II. However, water stress markedly modified the responses of photosystem II to superimposed constraints. The stability of photosystem II to heat was observed to increase strongly in leaves exposed to water stress conditions: heat treatments (e.g. 42 degrees C in the dark), which caused a complete and irreversible inhibition of photosystem II in well-watered (tomato) leaves, resulted in a small and fully reversible reduction of the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II in drought-stressed leaves. In vivo photoacoustic data indicated that photosystem I was highly resistant to both heat and water stresses. When leaves were illuminated with intense white light at 25 degrees C, photoinhibition damage of photosystem II was more pronounced in water-stressed leaves than in undesiccated controls. However, in nondehydrated leaves, photoinhibition of photosystem II was strongly temperature dependent, being drastically stimulated at high temperatures above 38 to 40 degrees C. As a consequence, when exposed to strong light at high temperature, photosystem II photochemistry was significantly less inhibited in dehydrated leaves than in control well-hydrated leaves. Our results demonstrate the existence of a marked antagonism between physicochemical stresses, with water stress enhancing the resistance of photosystem II to constraints (heat, strong light at high temperature) that are usually associated with drought in the field.},

abstract = {Relative water content (RWC) is used extensively to determine the water status of plants relative to their fully turgid condition. However, plants often adjust osmotically to salinity or water deficit, which maintains turgor pressure and obscures the definition of ‘full turgidity’.Toexplore this problem, turgorwasmeasured by isopiestic psychrometry in mature leaf blades of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) salinised to 150mM NaCl, or bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in soil dehydrated to varying degrees. Osmotic adjustment maintained turgor in all the plants but despite full maintenance in some of the salinised plants, their leafRWCdecreased substantially. This occurred because excess waterwas absorbed while the samples werefloated on water as part of theRWCmeasurement. Theabsorption falsely increased the weightof the ‘fully turgid’ condition, causingRWCtobeanomalouslylowby10–15\%.Cell solutionwas secreted into intercellular spaces and was seen under a microscope, which is a test encouraged for all RWC measurements. Several alternate methods are suggested for rehydrating tissues while minimising excess water absorption, but no simple definition of ‘full turgidity’ seems possible. In general, direct measurements of osmotic adjustment and turgor are preferred.},

abstract = {We report the successful culture of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) suspension cells in a bioreactor. In vitro propagation of this perennial monocotyledonous tree is an important part of the oil palm industry's approach to clonal propagation of high-yielding accessions. During culture of oil palm cells in a batch bioreactor, nutrients and extracellular metabolites were monitored, and kinetic parameters and nutrient-to-biomass conversion yields were calculated. The biomass increased approximately 3.5-fold per month, consistent with values reported for shake flask cultures. Although the carbon source was completely depleted by the end of the run, nitrogen sources remained in large excess and the sugar-to-biomass conversion yield remained low. Linear growth indicated that the cells were limited. The results obtained from the bioreactor runs indicated that we should be able to improve biomass production by carrying out optimization studies. Therefore, we initiated multi-factorial analyses using response surface experimental designs to investigate the effects of different nitrogen sources, as well as inoculum size and conditioned medium, on biomass production in flask cultures. Whereas glutamine does not have a significant effect on biomass production, ammonia has a positive effect up to an optimum concentration. Both inoculum density and conditioned medium have positive, synergistic effects on biomass production.},

abstract = {The relationships among the total water potential, osmotic potential, turgor potential, and relative water content were determined for leaves of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor [L.] Moench cvs. `RS 610' and `Shallu') with three different histories of water stress. Plants were adequately watered (control), or the soil was allowed to dry slowly until the predawn leaf water potential reached either -0.4 megapascal (MPa) (treatment A) or -1.6 MPa (treatment B). Severe soil and plant water deficits developed sooner after cessation of watering in `Shallu' than in `RS 610', but no significant differences in osmotic adjustment or tissue water relations were observed between the two cultivars. In both cultivars, the stress treatments altered the relationship between leaf water potential and relative water content, resulting in the previously stressed plants maintaining higher tissue water contents than control plants at the same leaf water potential. The osmotic potential at full turgor in the control sorghum was -0.7 MPa: stress pretreatment significantly lowered the osmotic potential to -1.1 and -1.6 MPa in stress treatments A and B, respectively. As a result of this osmotic adjustment, leaf turgor potentials at a given value of leaf water potential exceeded those of the control plants by 0.15 to 0.30 MPa in treatment A and by 0.5 to 0.65 MPa in treatment B. However, zero turgor potential occurred at approximately the same value of relative water content (94\%) irrespective of previous stress history. From the relationship between turgor potential and relative water content there was an approximate doubling of the volumetric elastic modulus, i.e. a halving of tissue elasticity, as a result of stress preconditioning. The influence of stress preconditioning on the moisture release curve is discussed.},

To improve salinity tolerance of crops, various traits can be incorporated, including ion exclusion, osmotic tolerance and tissue tolerance. We review the roles of a range of genes involved in salt tolerance traits. Different tissues and cells are adapted for specific and often diverse function, so it is important to express the genes in specific cell-types and to pyramid a range of traits. Modern biotechnology (marker-assisted selection or genetic engineering) needs to be increasingly used to introduce the correct combination of genes into elite crop cultivars.

abstract = {Potato and wheat plants were grown for 50 d at 400, 1000 and 10000 micromoles mol-1 carbon dioxide (CO2). and sweetpotato and soybean were grown at 1000 micromoles mol-1 CO2 in controlled environment chambers to study stomatal conductance and plant water use. Lighting was provided with fluorescent lamps as a 12 h photoperiod with 300 micromoles m-2 s-1 PAR. Mid-day stomatal conductances for potato were greatest at 400 and 10000 micromoles mol-1 and least at 1000 micromoles mol-1 CO2. Mid-day conductances for wheat were greatest at 400 micromoles mol-1 and least at 1000 and 10000 micromoles mol-1 CO2. Mid-dark period conductances for potato were significantly greater at 10000 micromoles mol-1 than at 400 or 1000 micromoles mol-1, whereas dark conductance for wheat was similar in all CO2 treatments. Temporarily changing the CO2 concentration from the native 1000 micromoles mol-1 to 400 micromoles mol-1 increased mid-day conductance for all species, while temporarily changing from 1000 to 10000 micromoles mol-1 also increased conductance for potato and sweetpotato. Temporarily changing the dark period CO2 from 1000 to 10000 micromoles mol-1 increased conductance for potato, soybean and sweetpotato. In all cases, the stomatal responses were reversible, i.e. conductances returned to original rates following temporary changes in CO2 concentration. Canopy water use for potato was greatest at 10000, intermediate at 400, and least at 1000 micromoles mol-1 CO2, whereas canopy water use for wheat was greatest at 400 and similar at 1000 and 10000 micromoles mol-1 CO2. Elevated CO2 treatments (i.e. 1000 and 10000 micromoles mol-1) resulted in increased plant biomass for both wheat and potato relative to 400 micromoles mol-1, and no injurious effects were apparent from the 10000 micromoles mol-1 treatment. Results indicate that super-elevated CO2 (i.e. 10000 micromoles mol-1) can increase stomatal conductance in some species, particularly during the dark period, resulting in increased water use and decreased water use efficiency.},

abstract = {Soil salinity is generally spatially heterogeneous, but our understanding of halophyte physiology under such conditions is limited. The growth and physiology of the dicotyledonous halophyte Atriplex nummularia was evaluated in split-root experiments to test whether growth is determined by: (i) the lowest; (ii) the highest; or (iii) the mean salinity of the root zone. In two experiments, plants were grown with uniform salinities or horizontally heterogeneous salinities (10-450 mM NaCl in the low-salt side and 670 mM in the high-salt side, or 10 mM NaCl in the low-salt side and 500-1500 mM in the high-salt side). The combined data showed that growth and gas exchange parameters responded most closely to the root-weighted mean salinity rather than to the lowest, mean, or highest salinity in the root zone. In contrast, midday shoot water potentials were determined by the lowest salinity in the root zone, consistent with most water being taken from the least negative water potential source. With uniform salinity, maximum shoot growth was at 120-230 mM NaCl; \~{}90\% of maximum growth occurred at 10 mM and 450 mM NaCl. Exposure of part of the roots to 1500 mM NaCl resulted in an enhanced (+40\%) root growth on the low-salt side, which lowered root-weighted mean salinity and enabled the maintenance of shoot growth. Atriplex nummularia grew even with extreme salinity in part of the roots, as long as the root-weighted mean salinity of the root zone was within the 10-450 mM range.},

abstract = {Measurement of in vivo chlorophyll a fluorescence at temperatures lower than 20 degrees C can cause an artifactual, nonphotochemically related overestimation of variable fluorescence leading to the calculation of negative values for the nonphotochemical quenching parameter and an underestimation of the photochemical quenching parameter. This artifact is observed only upon exposure of the leaf sample to actinic light. We suggest that a temperature differential between the fiber-optic probe and the leaf sample results in the deposition of water vapor on the probe that distorts the light path such that an increased modulated fluorescence signal is observed. This artifact is eradicated by ensuring that the end of the fiber-optic probe is kept free of condensation.},

abstract = {Bio-diesel is a fast-developing alternative fuel in many developed and developing countries of the world. The bio-diesel production from vegetable oils during 2004–2005 was estimated 2.36 million tonnes globally. Of this, EU countries accounted for about 82\% and USA about 6\%. Global bio-diesel production is set to reach some 24 billion litres by 2017. Shortage of edible oil for human consumption in developing countries does not favour its use for bio-diesel production. Hence non-edible oil from crops like Jatropha (Jatropha curcas) and Pongamia (Pongamia pinnata) is favoured for bio-diesel production and the trend is expected to continue. Especially J. curcas has gained attention in tropical and sub-tropical countries and has spread beyond its centre of origin, because of its hardiness, easy propagation, drought endurance, high oil content, rapid growth, adaptation to wide agro-climatic conditions, and multiple uses of plant as a whole. The full potential of J. curcas has not been realized due to several technological and economic reasons. One of the major reasons is the lack of high yielding varieties with high oil content. In this review, we attempt to discuss the currently available information on Jatropha species identity, taxonomy and description, distribution and ecological requirements of the species, possibilities of exploitation of genetic potentiality, exploitation of existing diversity for yield and oil content by direct selection, hybridization and creation of diversity by mutation, and biotechnological interventions.},

@article{Lawson2014,
abstract = {The control of gaseous exchange between the leaf and bulk atmosphere by stomata governs CO₂ uptake for photosynthesis and transpiration, determining plant productivity and water use efficiency. The balance between these two processes depends on stomatal responses to environmental and internal cues and the synchrony of stomatal behavior relative to mesophyll demands for CO₂. Here we examine the rapidity of stomatal responses with attention to their relationship to photosynthetic CO₂ uptake and the consequences for water use. We discuss the influence of anatomical characteristics on the velocity of changes in stomatal conductance and explore the potential for manipulating the physical as well as physiological characteristics of stomatal guard cells in order to accelerate stomatal movements in synchrony with mesophyll CO₂ demand and to improve water use efficiency without substantial cost to photosynthetic carbon fixation. We conclude that manipulating guard cell transport and metabolism is just as, if not more likely to yield useful benefits as manipulations of their physical and anatomical characteristics. Achieving these benefits should be greatly facilitated by quantitative systems analysis that connects directly the molecular properties of the guard cells to their function in the field.},

abstract = {Seed predation and seed dispersal can have strong effects on early life history stages of plants. These processes have often been studied as individual effects, but the degree to which their relative importance co-varies with seed predator abundance and how this influences seed germination rates is poorly understood. Therefore, we used a combination of observations and field experiments to determine the degree to which germination rates of the palm Astrocaryum mexicanum varied with abundance of a small mammal seed predator/disperser, Heteromys desmarestianus, in a lowland tropical forest. Patterns of abundance of the two species were strongly related; density of H. desmarestianus was low in sites with low density of A. mexicanum and vice versa. Rates of predation and dispersal of A. mexicanum seeds depended on abundance of H. desmarestianus; sites with high densities of H. desmarestianus had the highest rates of seed predation and lowest rates of seed germination, but a greater total number of seeds were dispersed and there was greater density of seedlings, saplings, and adults of A. mexicanum in these sites. When abundance of H. desmarestianus was experimentally reduced, rates of seed predation decreased, but so did dispersal of A. mexicanum seeds. Critically, rates of germination of dispersed seeds were 5 times greater than undispersed seeds. The results suggest that the relationship between A. mexicanum and H. desmarestianus is a conditional mutualism that results in a strong local effect on the abundance of each species. However, the magnitude and direction of these effects are determined by the relative strength of opposing, but related, mechanisms. A. mexicanum nuts provide H. desmarestianus with a critical food resource, and while seed predation on A. mexicanum nuts by H. desmarestianus is very intense, A. mexicanum ultimately benefits because of the relatively high germination rates of its seeds that are dispersed by H. desmarestianus.},

abstract = {Activity of the Calvin cycle enzyme sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) was increased by overexpression of a rice plants 9,311 (Oryza sativa L.) cDNA in rice plants zhonghua11 (Oryza sativa L.). The genetic engineering enabled the plants to accumulate SBPase in chloroplasts and resulted in enhanced tolerance to high temperature stress during growth of young seedlings. Moreover, CO(2) assimilation of transgenic plants was significantly more tolerant to high temperature than that of wild-type plants. The analyses of chlorophyll fluorescence and the content and activation of SBPase indicated that the enhancement of photosynthesis to high temperature was not related to the function of photosystem II but to the content and activation of SBPase. Western blotting analyses showed that high temperature stress led to the association of SBPase with the thylakoid membranes from the stroma fractions. However, such an association was much more pronounced in wild-type plants than that in transgenic plants. The results in this study suggested that under high temperature stress, SBPase maintained the activation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) by preventing the sequestration of Rubisco activase to the thylakoid membranes from the soluble stroma fraction and thus enhanced the tolerance of CO(2) assimilation to high temperature stress. The results suggested that overexpression of SBPase might be an effective method for enhancing high temperature tolerance of plants.},

@article{Munns2000,
abstract = {The role of leaf water relations in controlling cell expansion in leaves of water-stressed maize and barley depends on time scale. Sudden changes in leaf water status, induced by sudden changes in humidity, light and soil salinity, greatly affect leaf elongation rate, but often only transiently. With sufficiently large changes in salinity, leaf elongation rates are persistently reduced. When plants are kept fully turgid throughout such sudden environmental changes, by placing their roots in a pressure chamber and raising the pressure so that the leaf xylem sap is maintained at atmospheric pressure, both the transient and persistent changes in leaf elongation rate disappear. All these responses show that water relations are responsible for the sudden changes in leaf elongation rate resulting from sudden changes in water stress and putative root signals play no part. However, at a time scale of days, pressurization fails to maintain high rates of leaf elongation of plants in either saline or drying soil, indicating that root signals are overriding water relations effects. In both saline and drying soil, pressurization does raise the growth rate during the light period, but a subsequent decrease during the dark results in no net effect on leaf growth over a 24 h period. When transpirational demand is very high, however, growth-promoting effects of pressurization during the light period outweigh any reductions in the dark, resulting in a net increase in growth of pressurized plants over 24 h. Thus leaf water status can limit leaf expansion rates during periods of high transpiration despite the control exercised by hormonal effects on a 24 h basis.},

abstract = {The influence of different carbon sources and concentrations on in vitro shoot multiplication of date palm cv. Khanezi were investigated. Sucrose, glucose, fructose and maltose sugars were used at the following concentrations; 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 g l(-1). Shoot dry weight was significantly increased with increasing sugar concentrations while little growth was obtained in the absence of sugar. Concentrations of 30 and 60 g l(-1) were optimal for qualitative and quantitative shoot growth while abnormal growth was observed at 90 and 120 g l(-1) possibly due to osmotic stress. Sugar type had significant effects on most parameters measured except bud formation. Fructose produced the highest values of dry weights compared with other carbon sources. In addition, glucose, fructose and maltose were almost equivalently effective as a carbon source for culture of date palm compared with sucrose. It is also noticed in this study that the root formation was enhanced as the sugar concentration increased (60 g l(-1) and above). This rooting of buds generally reduced their ability to multiply during multiplication stage and occasionally inhibited bud formation especially in higher concentration of sugar.},

abstract = {Examines procrastination from a rational-emotive perspective. The irrational bases of procrastination, its resistance to change, and ways to overcome the problem are discussed. The procrastinator, a person with delayed self- development and self-maintenance, usually holds 2 irrational beliefs: he views himself as inadequate and the world as too difficult and demanding. Behavioral manifestations of these beliefs are described, and the major mechanisms through which change is resisted. Ways to reduce or minimize the tendency to procrastinate by self-management techniques are presented. ((c) 1997 APA/PsycINFO, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {In diatoms, the non-photochemical fluorescence quenching (NPQ) regulates photosynthesis during light fluctuations. NPQ is associated with an enzymatic xanthophyll cycle (XC) which is controlled by the light-driven transthylakoid proton gradient (delta pH). In this report, special illumination conditions and chemicals were used to perturb the kinetics of the delta pH build-up, of the XC and of NPQ. We found that the delta pH-related acidification of the lumen is also needed for NPQ to develop by switching the xanthophylls to an 'activated' state, probably via the protonation of light-harvesting antenna proteins. It confirms the NPQ model previously proposed for diatoms.},

abstract = {Thermal and chlorophyll fluorescence imaging are powerful tools for the study of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of leaf transpiration and photosynthetic performance. The relative advantages and disadvantages of these techniques are discussed. When combined, they can highlight pre-symptomatic responses not yet apparent in visual spectrum images and provide specific signatures for diagnosis of distinct diseases and abiotic stresses. In addition, their use for diagnosis and for selection for stomatal or photosynthetic mutants, these techniques can be applied for stress tolerance screening. For example, rapid screening for stomatal responses can be achieved by thermal imaging, while, combined with fluorescence imaging to study photosynthesis, they can potentially be used to derive leaf water use efficiency as a screening parameter. A particular advantage of imaging is that it allows continuous automated monitoring of dynamic spatial variation. Examples of applications include the study of growth and development of plant lines differing in stress resistance, yield, circadian clock-controlled responses, and the possible interactions between these parameters. In the future, such dual-imaging systems could be extended with complementary techniques such as hyperspectral and blue-green fluorescence imaging. This would result in an increased number of quantified parameters which will increase the power of stress diagnosis and the potential for screening of stress-tolerant genotypes.},

SCAR T12 and SCAR W11 produce products in hermaphrodite and male plants and only rarely in females. SCAR T1 produces a product in all papayas regardless of plant sex. SCAR T12 and SCAR W11 showed no recombination in a population of 182 F2 plants from a 'SunUp' by 'Kapoho' cross. Based on these results a PCR-based technique for rapidly and accurately determining the sex of papaya plants was developed using either W11 or T12 to detect the hermaphrodite or male allele and T1, which amplifies a product regardless of sex type, as a positive control. The sexing technique, using SCAR T12 and SCAR T1 as a positive control, was used to correctly predict hermaphrodite papaya plants in a population of seedlings with an overall accuracy of 99.2\%.},

@article{Hymus1999a,
abstract = {Previous studies of the effects of growth at elevated CO(2) on energy partitioning in the photosynthetic apparatus have produced conflicting results. The hypothesis was developed and tested that elevated CO(2) increases photochemical energy use when there is a high demand for assimilates and decreases usage when demand is low. Modulated chlorophyll a fluorescence and leaf gas exchange were measured on needles at the top of a mature, 12-m loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) forest. Trees were exposed to ambient CO(2) or ambient plus 20 Pa CO(2) using free-air CO(2) enrichment. During April and August, periods of shoot growth, light-saturated photosynthesis and linear electron transport were increased by elevated CO(2). In November, when growth had ceased but temperatures were still moderate, CO(2) treatment had no significant effect on linear electron transport. In February, when low temperatures were likely to inhibit translocation, CO(2) treatment caused a significant decrease in linear electron transport. This coincided with a slower recovery of the maximum photosystem II efficiency on transfer of needles to the shade, indicating that growth in elevated CO(2) induced a more persistent photoinhibition. Both the summer increase and the winter decrease in linear electron transport in elevated CO(2) resulted from a change in photochemical quenching, not in the efficiency of energy transfer within the photosystem II antenna. There was no evidence of any effect of CO(2) on photochemical energy sinks other than carbon metabolism. Our results suggest that elevated CO(2) may increase the effects of winter stress on evergreen foliage.},

Full strength media were used separately to regenerate plantlets directly using immature zygotic embryos (IZEs), and through somatic embryogenesis of calli obtained from IZEs. The plantlets regenerated by direct regeneration on three media were examined for shoot length and rooting percentage. For the induction of callus, somatic embryogenesis, and rooting modified Y3 medium was the most effective. In conclusion, the results indicate that modified Y3 medium is the most suitable for direct regeneration, callus induction and somatic embryogenesis in E. guineensis.},

abstract = {An aquaponic system was designed to investigate effects of foliar applications of some micro- and macro-nutrients on tomato growth and yield in comparison with a hydroponic system. Common carp, grass carp and silver carp were stocked in the rearing tanks at 15, 20 and 15fishm−3, respectively. The fish were fed three times daily with a pellet diet containing 46\% protein. Fourteen days old tomatoes seedlings were transplanted on to growth bed units of aquaponic and hydroponic systems after stocking of carp fish for 2.5 months in the rearing tanks. Foliar nutrients application began 30 days after transplantation. Eight treatments were used, untreated control, foliar application at the rate of 250mLplant−1 with 0.5gL−1K2SO4, MgSO4·7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, MnSO4·H2O, H3BO3, ZnCl2, and CuSO4·5H2O. Plants were sprayed twice a month. The results showed that biomass gains of tomatoes were higher in hydroponics as compared to aquaponics. Foliar application of K, Mg, Fe, Mn, and B increased vegetative growth of plants in the aquaponics. In the hydroponics, only Fe and B had positive effects on plant growth. Cluster number per plant in aquaponics was lower than in hydroponics treatments, but it increased with foliar application of elements. There was no difference in fruit number and yield between aquaponics and hydroponics grown plants in the control treatments. Except Cu, foliar spray of all elements significantly increased plant fruit number and yield in the aquaponics in order of: K>Fe>Mn>Zn>Mg>B. In the hydroponics, foliar application of K, Mg and Zn increased fruit number and yield of plants compared to control. These results indicated that foliar application of some elements can effectively alleviate nutrient deficiencies in tomatoes grown on aquaponics.},

@article{Zhu2015,
abstract = {Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonization can induce both the local and the systemic increase in phenolic accumulation in hosts. However, the signaling molecules responsible for the systemic induction is still unclear. In this study, a split-root rhizobox system was designed to explore these molecules, with one half of clover (Trifolium repense) roots colonized by AMF, Funneliformis mosseae (formerly known as Glomus mosseae), and the other not (NM/M). Plants with two halves both (M/M) or neither (NM/NM) inoculated were also established for comparison. The contents of phenols and the accumulation of salicylic acid (SA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and nitric oxide (NO) in roots were monitored, the activities of l-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in roots were assayed, and the expressions of pal and chs (gene encoding chalcone synthase) genes in roots were also quantified using qRT-PCR. Results indicated that when phenolic content in NM/NM plants was lower than that in M/M plants, AMF colonization systemically induced the increase in phenolic content in NM/M plants. Similarly, the accumulations of SA and H2O2 were increased by AMF both locally and systemically, while that of NO was only increased locally. Moreover, enzyme assay and qRT-PCR were in accordance with these results. These data suggest that AMF colonization can systemically increase the phenolic biosynthesis, and SA and H2O2 are possibly the signaling molecules involved. The role of MeSA, a signaling molecule capable of long distance transport in this process, is also discussed.},

abstract = {Salt and drought stress signal transduction consists of ionic and osmotic homeostasis signaling pathways, detoxification (i.e., damage control and repair) response pathways, and pathways for growth regulation. The ionic aspect of salt stress is signaled via the SOS pathway where a calcium-responsive SOS3-SOS2 protein kinase complex controls the expression and activity of ion transporters such as SOS1. Osmotic stress activates several protein kinases including mitogen-activated kinases, which may mediate osmotic homeostasis and/or detoxification responses. A number of phospholipid systems are activated by osmotic stress, generating a diverse array of messenger molecules, some of which may function upstream of the osmotic stress-activated protein kinases. Abscisic acid biosynthesis is regulated by osmotic stress at multiple steps. Both ABA-dependent and -independent osmotic stress signaling first modify constitutively expressed transcription factors, leading to the expression of early response transcriptional activators, which then activate downstream stress tolerance effector genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is well known that the Amazon region presents a huge biodiversity; therefore, countless natural resources are being employed in the production of phytocosmetics and phytomedicines.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to obtain emulsions produced with Buriti oil and non-ionic surfactants.

METHODS: Two surfactant systems were employed (Steareth-2 associated to Ceteareth-5 and to Ceteareth-20) to produce the emulsions using phase diagram method. Emulsions were obtained by echo-planar imaging method at 75°C. Rheological behavior and zeta potential were evaluated, and accelerated stability tests were performed.

RESULTS: All emulsions analyzed presented pseudoplastic behavior. Zeta potential values were obtained between -14.2 and -53.3 mV. The formulations did not show changes in either physical stability, pH, or rheological behavior after accelerated stability tests. Significant differences were observed only after temperature cycling test.

CONCLUSION: Based on these results, the emulsions obtained could be considered as promising delivery systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increased understanding of leaf area development is important in a number of fields: in food and non-food crops, for example short rotation forestry as a biofuels feedstock, leaf area is intricately linked to biomass productivity; in paleontology leaf shape characteristics are used to reconstruct paleoclimate history. Such fields require measurement of large collections of leaves, with resulting conclusions being highly influenced by the accuracy of the phenotypic measurement process.

RESULTS: We have developed LAMINA (Leaf shApe deterMINAtion), a new tool for the automated analysis of images of leaves. LAMINA has been designed to provide classical indicators of leaf shape (blade dimensions) and size (area), which are typically required for correlation analysis to biomass productivity, as well as measures that indicate asymmetry in leaf shape, leaf serration traits, and measures of herbivory damage (missing leaf area). In order to allow Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to be performed, the location of a chosen number of equally spaced boundary coordinates can optionally be returned.

CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the use of the software on a set of 500 scanned images, each containing multiple leaves, collected from a common garden experiment containing 116 clones of Populus tremula (European trembling aspen) that are being used for association mapping, as well as examples of leaves from other species. We show that the software provides an efficient and accurate means of analysing leaf area in large datasets in an automated or semi-automated work flow.},

@article{Cernusak2007,
abstract = {The response of whole-plant water-use efficiency, termed transpiration efficiency (TE), to variation in soil fertility was assessed in a tropical pioneer tree, Ficus insipida Willd. Measurements of stable isotope ratios (delta(13)C, delta(18)O, delta(15)N), elemental concentrations (C, N, P), plant growth, instantaneous leaf gas exchange, and whole-plant water use were used to analyse the mechanisms controlling TE. Plants were grown individually in 19 l pots with non-limiting soil moisture. Soil fertility was altered by mixing soil with varying proportions of rice husks, and applying a slow release fertilizer. A large variation was observed in leaf photosynthetic rate, mean relative growth rate (RGR), and TE in response to experimental treatments; these traits were well correlated with variation in leaf N concentration. Variation in TE showed a strong dependence on the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO(2) mole fractions (c(i)/c(a)); both for instantaneous measurements of c(i)/c(a) (R(2)=0.69, P <0.0001, n=30), and integrated estimates based on C isotope discrimination (R(2)=0.88, P <0.0001, n=30). On the other hand, variations in the leaf-to-air humidity gradient, unproductive water loss, and respiratory C use probably played only minor roles in modulating TE in the face of variable soil fertility. The pronounced variation in TE resulted from a combination of the strong response of c(i)/c(a) to leaf N, and inherently high values of c(i)/c(a) for this tropical tree species; these two factors conspired to cause a 4-fold variation among treatments in (1-c(i)/c(a)), the term that actually modifies TE. Results suggest that variation in plant N status could have important implications for the coupling between C and water exchange in tropical forest trees.},

abstract = {Measuring plant chlorophyll concentration is a well-known and commonly used method in agriculture and environmental applications for monitoring plant health, which also correlates with many other plant parameters including, e.g., carotenoids, nitrogen, maximum green fluorescence, etc. Direct chlorophyll measurement using chemical extraction is destructive, complex and time-consuming, which has led to the development of mobile optical readers, providing non-destructive but at the same time relatively expensive tools for evaluation of plant chlorophyll levels. Here we demonstrate accurate measurement of chlorophyll concentration in plant leaves using Google Glass and a custom-developed software application together with a cost-effective leaf holder and multi-spectral illuminator device. Two images, taken using Google Glass, of a leaf placed in our portable illuminator device under red and white (i.e., broadband) light-emitting-diode (LED) illumination are uploaded to our servers for remote digital processing and chlorophyll quantification, with results returned to the user in less than 10 seconds. Intensity measurements extracted from the uploaded images are mapped against gold-standard colorimetric measurements made through a commercially available reader to generate calibration curves for plant leaf chlorophyll concentration. Using five plant species to calibrate our system, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately and rapidly estimate chlorophyll concentration of fifteen different plant species under both indoor and outdoor lighting conditions. This Google Glass based chlorophyll measurement platform can display the results in spatiotemporal and tabular forms and would be highly useful for monitoring of plant health in environmental and agriculture related applications, including e.g., urban plant monitoring, indirect measurements of the effects of climate change, and as an early indicator for water, soil, and air quality degradation.},

To this end, accurate, relevant phenotyping plays an increasingly pivotal role for the selection of drought-resilient genotypes and, more in general, for a meaningful dissection of the quantitative genetic landscape that underscores the adaptive response of crops to drought. A major and universally recognized obstacle to a more effective translation of the results produced by drought-related studies into improved cultivars is the difficulty in properly phenotyping in a high-throughput fashion in order to identify the quantitative trait loci that govern yield and related traits across different water regimes. This review provides basic principles and a broad set of references useful for the management of phenotyping practices for the study and genetic dissection of drought tolerance and, ultimately, for the release of drought-tolerant cultivars.},

abstract = {To help identify an irrigation system and irrigation strategy to improve durum wheat production in the context of water scarcity of Tunisia, the PILOTE (operative water balance and yield estimation) model and the RAIEOPT (furrow irrigation) model are coupled. The first step was to choose the most efficient surface irrigation system (SIS) with its irrigation strategy. On the basis of field experiment data, an economic-optimization model allows the identification of the best SIS with its irrigation strategy for conditions of water scarcity in Tunisia. The furrow system with an inter-furrow spacing of 1.5m and a strategy which consists on irrigating when the soil water reserve is 80\% depleted are selected by the optimization model. Using “deficit irrigation” principles which establish a ratio between the amount of water applied to a given crop and a economically acceptable target yield value, irrigation strategies for sprinkler and the selected SIS are identified. RAIEOPT–PILOTE coupling is used to perform this analysis for SIS. The results of the simulations, based on climatic data spanning the last 20 years, raise questions about the suitability of sprinkler irrigation method for clay soil conditions in Tunisia. This paper also aims to contribute to future economic studies that will take into account social constraints. This study should allow managers to choose between sprinkler irrigation methods and SIS modernization.},

abstract = {Tolerance to drought is a quantitative trait, with a complex phenotype, often confounded by plant phenology. Breeding for drought tolerance is further complicated since several types of abiotic stress, such as high temperatures, high irradiance, and nutrient toxicities or deficiencies can challenge crop plants simultaneously. Although marker-assisted selection is now widely deployed in wheat, it has not contributed significantly to cultivar improvement for adaptation to low-yielding environments and breeding has relied largely on direct phenotypic selection for improved performance in these difficult environments. The limited success of the physiological and molecular breeding approaches now suggests that a careful rethink is needed of our strategies in order to understand better and breed for drought tolerance. A research programme for increasing drought tolerance of wheat should tackle the problem in a multi-disciplinary approach, considering interaction between multiple stresses and plant phenology, and integrating the physiological dissection of drought-tolerance traits and the genetic and genomics tools, such as quantitative trait loci (QTL), microarrays, and transgenic crops. In this paper, recent advances in the genetics and genomics of drought tolerance in wheat and barley are reviewed and used as a base for revisiting approaches to analyse drought tolerance in wheat. A strategy is then described where a specific environment is targeted and appropriate germplasm adapted to the chosen environment is selected, based on extensive definition of the morpho-physiological and molecular mechanisms of tolerance of the parents. This information was used to create structured populations and develop models for QTL analysis and positional cloning.},

@article{Schachtman2008,
abstract = {Chemical signals are important for plant adaptation to water stress. As soils become dry, root-sourced signals are transported via the xylem to leaves and result in reduced water loss and decreased leaf growth. The presence of chemical signals in xylem sap is accepted, but the identity of these signals is controversial. Abscisic acid (ABA), pH, cytokinins, a precursor of ethylene, malate and other unidentified factors have all been implicated in root to shoot signaling under drought. This review describes current knowledge of, and advances in, research on chemical signals that are sent from roots under drought. The contribution of these different potential signals is discussed within the context of their role in stress signaling.},

@article{Thumma2001,
abstract = {Previous studies have shown that a negative relationship exists between transpiration efficiency (TE) and carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) and between TE and specific leaf area (SLA) in Stylosanthes scabra. A glasshouse experiment was conducted to confirm these relationships in an F(2) population and to study the causal nature of these relationships through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. One hundred and twenty F(2) genotypes from a cross between two genotypes within S. scabra were used. Three replications for each genotype were maintained through vegetative propagation. Water stress was imposed by maintaining plants at 40\% of field capacity for about 45 d. To facilitate QTL analysis, a genetic linkage map consisting of 151 RAPD markers was developed. Results from this study show that Delta was significantly and negatively correlated with TE and biomass production. Similarly, SLA showed significant negative correlation with TE and biomass production. Most of the QTL for TE and Delta were present on linkage groups 5 and 11. Similarly, QTL for SLA, transpiration and biomass productivity traits were clustered on linkage groups 13 and 24. One unlinked marker was also associated with these traits. There were several markers coincident between different traits. At all the coincident QTL, the direction of QTL effects was consistent with phenotypic data. At the coincident markers between TE and Delta, high alleles of TE were associated with low alleles of Delta. Similarly, low alleles of SLA were associated with high alleles of biomass productivity traits and transpiration. At the coincident markers between trans-4-hydroxy-N:-methyl proline (MHP) and relative water content (RWC), low alleles of MHP were associated with high alleles of RWC. This study suggests the causal nature of the relationship between TE and Delta. Phenotypic data and QTL data show that SLA was more closely associated with biomass production than with TE. This study also shows that a cause-effect relationship may exist between SLA and biomass production.},

abstract = {Cassava or manioc (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a perennial shrub of the New World, currently is the sixth world food crop for more than 500 million people in tropical and sub-tropical Africa, Asia and Latin America. It is cultivated mainly by resource-limited small farmers for its starchy roots, which are used as human food either fresh when low in cyanogens or in many processed forms and products, mostly starch, flour, and for animal feed. Because of its inherent tolerance to stressful environments, where other food crops would fail, it is often considered a food-security source against famine, requiring minimal care. Under optimal environmental conditions, it compares favorably in production of energy with most other major staple food crops due to its high yield potential. Recent research at the Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT) in Colombia has demonstrated the ability of cassava to assimilate carbon at very high rates under high levels of humidity, temperature and solar radiation,which correlates with productivity across all environments whether dry or humid. When grown on very poor soils under prolonged drought for more than 6 months, the crop reduce both its leaf canopy and transpiration water loss, but its attached leaves remain photosynthetically active, though at greatly reduced rates. The main physiological mechanism underlying such a remarkable tolerance to drought was rapid stomatal closure under both atmospheric and edaphic water stress, protecting the leaf against dehydration while the plant depletes available soil water slowly during long dry periods. This drought tolerance mechanism leads to high crop water use efficiency values. Although the cassava fine root system is sparse, compared to other crops, it can penetrate below 2 m soil,thus enabling the crop to exploit deep water if available. Leaves of cassava and wild Manihot possess elevated activities of the C4 enzyme PEP carboxylase but lack the leaf Kranz anatomy typical of C4 species, pointing to the need for further research on cultivated and wild Manihot to further improve its photosynthetic potential and yield,particularly under stressful environments. Moreover, a wide range in values of Km (CO2) for the C3 photosynthetic enzyme Rubisco was found among cassava cultivars indicating the possibility of selection for higher affinity to CO2, and consequently higher leaf photosynthesis. Several plant traits that may be of value in crop breeding and improvement have been identified, such as an extensive fine root system, long leaf life, strong root sink and high leaf photosynthesis. Selection of parental materials for tolerance to drought and infertile soils under representative field conditions have resulted in developing improved cultivars that have high yields in favorable environments while producing reasonable and stable yields under stress.},

abstract = {AbstractIn semiarid regions where water resources are scarce, irrigation water use efficiency is an important issue. Although subsurface drip irrigation is a very efficient irrigation method, it has had relatively limited expansion due to several disadvantages such as the clogging of emitters and the difficulty of detecting leakages and repairing them. Recently, an alternative subsurface irrigation method that is able to avoid most of the aforementioned drawbacks has been introduced in southern Spain. The objective of this work is to assess the performance of this method and to compare it to a surface drip-irrigation system. To achieve this objective, a three-year field experiment was carried out in an organic olive orchard (Olea europaea L.) located in the province of Almer\'{\i}a, Spain. The water-use efficiency of both irrigation methods was analyzed under three different irrigation water supplies. The results show that the alternative subsurface irrigation method seems to perform better than the drip irrig...},

abstract = {A major task of our time is to ensure adequate food supplies for the world's current population (now nearing 7 billion) in a sustainable way while protecting the vital functions and biological diversity of the global environment. The task of providing for a growing population is likely to be even more difficult in view of actual and potential changes in climatic conditions due to global warming, and as the population continues to grow. Current projections suggest that the world's temperatures will rise 1.8-4.0 by 2100 and population may reach 8 billion by the year 2025 and some 9 billion by mid-century, after which it may stabilize. This book addresses these critical issues by presenting the science needed not only to understand climate change effects on crops but also to adapt current agricultural systems, particularly in regard to genetics, to the changing conditions.Crop Adaptation to Climate Change covers a spectrum of issues related to both crops and climatic conditions. The first two sections provide a foundation on the factors involved in climate stress, assessing current climate change by region and covering crop physiological responses to these changes. The third and final section contains chapters focused on specific crops and the current research to improve their genetic adaptation to climate change.Written by an international team of authors, Crop Adaptation to Climate Change is a timely look at the potentially serious consequences of climate change for our global food supply, and is an essential resource for academics, researchers and professionals in the fields of crop science, agronomy, plant physiology and molecular biology; crop consultants and breeders; as well as climate and food scientists.},

abstract = {Understanding the variability of plant WUE and its control mechanism can promote the comprehension to the coupling relationship of water and carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystem, which is the foundation for developing water-carbon coupling cycle model. In this paper, we made clear the differences of net assimilation rate, transpiration rate, and WUE between the two species by comparing the experiment data of soybean (Glycine max Merr.) and maize (Zea mays L.) plants under water and soil nutrient stresses. WUE of maize was about two and a half times more than that of soybean in the same weather conditions. Enhancement of water stresses led to the marked decrease of Am and Em of two species, but water stresses of some degree could improve WUE, and this effect was more obvious for soybean. WUE of the two species changed with psiL in a second-order curve relation, and the WUE at high fertilization was higher than that at low fertilization, this effect was especially obvious for maize. Moreover, according to the synthetic model of photosynthesis-transpiration based on stomatal behavior (SMPTSB) presented by Yu et al. (2001), the WUE model and its applicability were discussed with the data measured in this experiment. The WUE estimated by means of the model accorded well with the measured values. However, this model underestimated the WUE for maize slightly, thus further improvement on the original model was made in this study. Finally, by discussing some physiological factors controlling Am and WUE, we made clear the physiological explanation for differences of the relative contributions of stomata- and mesophyll processes to control of Am and WUE, and the applicability of WUE model between the two species. Because the requirement to stomatal conductance by unit change of net assimilation rate is different, the responses of opening-closing activity of stomata to environmental stresses are different between the two species. To obtain the same level of net assimilation rate, soybean has to open its stomata more widely to keep small stomatal resistance, as compared with maize.},

abstract = {Abiotic stresses including drought are serious threats to the sustainability of crop yields accounting for more crop productivity losses than any other factor in rainfed agriculture. Success in breeding for better adapted varieties to abiotic stresses depend upon the concerted efforts by various research domains including plant and cell physiology, molecular biology, genetics, and breeding. Use of modern molecular biology tools for elucidating the control mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance, and for engineering stress tolerant crops is based on the expression of specific stress-related genes. Hence, genetic engineering for developing stress tolerant plants, based on the introgression of genes that are known to be involved in stress response and putative tolerance, might prove to be a faster track towards improving crop varieties. Far beyond the initial attempts to insert "single-action" genes, engineering of the regulatory machinery involving transcription factors has emerged as a new tool now for controlling the expression of many stress-responsive genes. Nevertheless, the task of generating transgenic cultivars is not only limited to the success in the transformation process, but also proper incorporation of the stress tolerance. Evaluation of the transgenic plants under stress conditions, and understanding the physiological effect of the inserted genes at the whole plant level remain as major challenges to overcome. This review focuses on the recent progress in using transgenic technology for the improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. This includes discussion on the evaluation of abiotic stress response and the protocols for testing the transgenic plants for their tolerance under close-to-field conditions.},

abstract = {Water status is the main factor affecting rice production. In order to understand rice strategies in response to drought condition in the field, the drought-responsive mechanisms at the physiological and molecular levels were studied in two rice genotypes with contrasting susceptibility to drought stress at reproductive stage. After 20 d of drought treatment, the osmotic potential of leaves reduced 78\% and 8\% in drought susceptible rice cultivar Zhenshan97B and tolerant rice cultivar IRAT109, respectively. The panicle lengths had no obvious changes in drought stressed Zhenshan97B and IRAT109, suggesting that drought stress impose less effect on assimilate translocation from leaf to vegetative growth of panicles. IRAT109 showed more extensive deeper root growth that could be considered a second line of defense against drought stress. The C(i)/C(a) ratio exhibited enhancement over reduction of g(s) in both cultivars, reflecting the non-stomatal limitation to photosynthesis occurred during drought stress. Orthophosphate dikinase, glycine dehydrogenase, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco), glycine hydroxymethyltransferase and ATP synthase were down-regulated for Zhenshan97B in response to drought stress, suggesting the reduction of capacity of carbon assimilation in this rice cultivar. In drought-stressed IRAT109, transketolase, Rubisco were down-regulated, however, Rubisco activase and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, which might alleviate the damage on Rubisco by drought stress, were up-regulated. The increased abundances of chloroplastic superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] and dehydroascorbate reductase might provide antioxidant protection for IRAT109 against damage by dehydration.},

abstract = {Moringa oleifera Lam (horseradish tree; tender pod or fruits) has been consumed as a vegetable and utilized as a major ingredient of healthy Thai cuisine. Previous studies have shown that M. oleifera pod extracts act as bifunctional inducers along with displaying antioxidant properties and also inhibiting skin papillomagenesis in mice. This study was aimed to determine the nutritive value, and clastogenic and anticlastogenic potentials of M. oleifera pod. The nutritive value was determined according to AOAC methods. The clastogenic and anticlastogenic potentials were determined using the in vivo erythrocyte micronucleus assay in the mouse. Eighty male mice were fed semi-purified diets containing 1.5\%, 3.0\% and 6.0\% of ground freeze-dried boiled M. oleifera pod (bMO) for 2 weeks prior to administration of both direct-acting (mitomycin C, MMC) and indirect-acting (7, 12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, DMBA), clastogens. Blood samples were collected at 0, 24, 48 and 72 h, dropped on acridine orange-coated slides, and then counted for reticulocytes both with and without micronuclei by fluorescence microscopy. The nutritive value of 100 g bMO consisted of: moisture content, 8.2 g; protein, 19.2 g; fat, 3.9 g; carbohydrate (dietary fiber included), 60.5 g; dietary fiber, 37.5 g; ash, 8.1 g and energy, 354 kcal. Freeze-dried boiled M. oleifera had no clastogenic activity in the mouse while it possessed anticlastogenic activity against both direct and indirect-acting clastogens. Freeze-dried boiled M. oleifera pod at 1.5\%, 3.0\% and 6.0\% in the diets decreased the number of micronucleated peripheral reticulocytes (MNRETs) induced by both MMC and DMBA. However, the effect was statistically significant in the dose dependent manner only in the MMC-treated group. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that bMO has no clastogenicity and possesses anticlastogenic potential against clastogens, and particularly a direct-acting clastogen in the mouse.},

abstract = {Measurements of 810 nm transmittance changes in leaves, simultaneously with Chl fluorescence, CO(2) uptake and O(2) evolution, were carried out on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) leaves with altered expression of plastidic NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase. Electron transport rates were calculated: J(C) from the CO(2) uptake rate considering ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and oxygenation, J(O) from the O(2) evolution rate, J(F) from Chl fluorescence parameters and J(I) from the post-illumination re-reduction speed of PSI donors. In the absence of external O(2), J(O) equaled (1.005 +/- 0.003) J(C), independent of the transgenic treatment, light intensity and CO(2) concentration. This showed that nitrite and oxaloacetate reduction rates were very slow. The Mehler-type O(2) reduction was evaluated from the rate of electron accumulation at PSI after the O(2) concentration was decreased from 210 to 20 mmol mol(-1), and resulted in <1\% of the linear flow. J(F) and J(I) did not differ from J(C) while photosynthesis was light-limited, but considerably exceeded J(C) at saturating light. Then, typically, J(F) = 1.2 J(C) and J(I) = 1.3 J(C), and J(F) -J(C) and J(I) -J(C) depended little on CO(2) and O(2) concentrations. The results showed that the alternative and cyclic electron flow necessary to compensate variations in the ATP/NADPH ratio were only a few percent of the linear flow. The data do not support the requirement of 14H(+)/3ATP by the chloroplast ATP synthase. We suggest that the fast PSI cyclic electron flow J(I) - J(C), as well as the fast J(F) - J(C) are energy-dissipating cycles around PSI and PSII at light saturation.},

abstract = {To counter the effects of environmental stresses, the plants must undergo detoxification that is crucial to avoid the accumulation of damaging free oxygen radicals (ROI). Here, we detail the oxidative damage, the antioxidant composition, and the osmoprotection achieved in transgenic plants of peanut overexpressing the AtDREB1A transgene, driven by a stress-inducible promoter (Atrd29A) when exposed to progressive water stress conditions. This study explored the biochemical mechanisms where (i) the antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APOX), and glutathione reductase (GR) accumulated in the transgenic plants at comparably higher levels than their untransformed counterparts under dry soil conditions, (ii) a significant increase in the proline levels in the transgenic plants was observed in dry soils, and (iii) a dramatic increase in the lipid peroxidation in the untransformed controls in drier soils. Most of the biochemical parameters related to the antioxidative machinery in the tested peanut transgenics were triggered by the overexpression of AtDREB1A that appeared to differ from the untransformed controls. The antioxidants showed a negative correlation with the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) thresholds, where the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) started decreasing in the tested plants. However, no significant relationship was observed between any of these biochemical indicators and the higher transpiration efficiency (TE) values found in the transgenic events. Our results show that changes in the antioxidative machinery in these transgenic peanut plants (overexpressing the AtDREB1A transcription factor) under water-limiting conditions played no causative role in improved TE.},

abstract = {The effects of osmolytes, osmotic potential ($\Psi$s), temperature, and their interactions on the germinability, germination rate, and other germination parameters of the invasive shrub Prosopis juliflora, which grows in the semiarid environmental conditions of the Caatinga in northeast Brazil, were evaluated. To study the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and NaCl stress and temperature on germination, two separate experiments were carried out at the Plant Ecophysiology Laboratory of the Federal University of Pernambuco in 2011. The overall germinability decreased significantly with increases in both PEG (one-way anova, F4,75=111.21, P≤0.001) and NaCl (one-way anova, F4,75=12.82, P≤0.001); however, the effects were more accentuated with PEG than NaCl. The PEG-treated seeds maintained their germinability, even when they were subjected to a $\Psi$s=-1MPa after being rinsed and allowed to germinate on deionized water. In contrast, NaCl-treated seeds usually lost their ability to germinate; this fact was possibly linked to the accumulation of Na+ and Cl- in the cells, which may have contributed to a loss of membrane function that led to the death of the embryos. Although numerous studies describing seed germination in the presence of osmolytes have been conducted, studies that show the interactions between osmolytes, osmotic potentials, and temperature are scarce. The present study is the first to describe these interactions for P. juliflora seeds. © 2013 The Society for the Study of Species Biology.},

@article{Gu2012,
abstract = {Photosynthesis is fundamental to biomass production, but sensitive to drought. To understand the genetics of leaf photosynthesis, especially under drought, upland rice cv. Haogelao, lowland rice cv. Shennong265, and 94 of their introgression lines (ILs) were studied at flowering and grain filling under drought and well-watered field conditions. Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were conducted to evaluate eight photosynthetic traits. Since these traits are very sensitive to fluctuations in microclimate during measurements under field conditions, observations were adjusted for microclimatic differences through both a statistical covariant model and a physiological approach. Both approaches identified leaf-to-air vapour pressure difference as the variable influencing the traits most. Using the simple sequence repeat (SSR) linkage map for the IL population, 1-3 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected per trait-stage-treatment combination, which explained between 7.0\% and 30.4\% of the phenotypic variance of each trait. The clustered QTLs near marker RM410 (the interval from 57.3 cM to 68.4 cM on chromosome 9) were consistent over both development stages and both drought and well-watered conditions. This QTL consistency was verified by a greenhouse experiment under a controlled environment. The alleles from the upland rice at this interval had positive effects on net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), and the maximum efficiency of light-adapted open PSII. However, the allele of another main QTL from upland rice was associated with increased drought sensitivity of photosynthesis. These results could potentially be used in breeding programmes through marker-assisted selection to improve drought tolerance and photosynthesis simultaneously.},

@article{Ray1998,
abstract = {Many experiments are conducted in greenhouses or growth chambers in which plants are grown in pots. Considerable research has shown that pots can have a limiting effect on overall plant growth. This research was undertaken to examine the effects of pot size specifically on transpiration response of maize (Zea mays L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) plants under- going water-deficit stress. Maize and soybean experi- ments were conducted similarly, but as separate experiments. Maize plants were grown in 2.3, 4.1, 9.1, and 16.2 l pots sealed to prevent water loss except by transpiration. For each pot size, plants were divided into two watering regimes, a well-watered control and a water-deficit regime. Water deficits were imposed by simply not rewatering the pots. Soybean was exam- ined in a similar manner, but only the three larger pot sizes were used in the experiment. For both maize and soybean, and in both watering regimes, there was a significant reduction of shoot dry weight and total transpiration with decreasing pot size. However, there were no significant differences among pot sizes in the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) point at which transpiration began to decline (FTSW\#0.31 for maize and\#0.35 for soybean) or in the overall relation- ship of transpiration rate to soil water content in response to water deficits. These results indicated that, regardless of pot size or plant size, the overriding factor determining transpirational response to drought stress was soil water content.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine source variation in Jatropha curcas seeds collected from ten locations in Central India. A significant seed source variation was observed in seed morphology (colour, size and weight), seed germination (viability, germination percent, germination energy, germination value) and seedling growth parameters (survival percentage, seedling height, collar diameter, leave/plant, and seedling biomass). The seed source of Chhindwara (M.P.) was found as the best source in comparison to others. The phenotypic and genotypic variance, their coefficient of variability and broad sense heritability also showed a sizeable variability. This offers a breeder ample scope to undertake screening and selection of seed sources for the desired traits. Further, high percentage of heritability coupled with moderate intensity of genetic gain, was observed for seed germination traits, which signifies that germination is under strong genetic control and good amount of heritable additive genetic component can be exploited for improvement of this species.},

@article{Bucksch2014a,
abstract = {Current plant phenotyping technologies to characterize agriculturally relevant traits have been primarily developed for use in laboratory and/or greenhouse conditions. In the case of root architectural traits, this limits phenotyping efforts, largely, to young plants grown in specialized containers and growth media. Hence, novel approaches are required to characterize mature root systems of older plants grown under actual soil conditions in the field. Imaging methods able to address the challenges associated with characterizing mature root systems are rare due, in part, to the greater complexity of mature root systems, including the larger size, overlap, and diversity of root components. Our imaging solution combines a field-imaging protocol and algorithmic approach to analyze mature root systems grown in the field. Via two case studies, we demonstrate how image analysis can be utilized to estimate localized root traits that reliably capture heritable architectural diversity as well as environmentally induced architectural variation of both monocot and dicot plants. In the first study, we show that our algorithms and traits (including 13 novel traits inaccessible to manual estimation) can differentiate nine maize (Zea mays) genotypes 8 weeks after planting. The second study focuses on a diversity panel of 188 cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) genotypes to identify which traits are sufficient to differentiate genotypes even when comparing plants whose harvesting date differs up to 14 d. Overall, we find that automatically derived traits can increase both the speed and reproducibility of the trait estimation pipeline under field conditions.},

@article{White2013,
abstract = {Crop production is often restricted by the availability of essential mineral elements. For example, the availability of N, P, K, and S limits low-input agriculture, the phytoavailability of Fe, Zn, and Cu limits crop production on alkaline and calcareous soils, and P, Mo, Mg, Ca, and K deficiencies, together with proton, Al and Mn toxicities, limit crop production on acid soils. Since essential mineral elements are acquired by the root system, the development of crop genotypes with root traits increasing their acquisition should increase yields on infertile soils. This paper examines root traits likely to improve the acquisition of these elements and observes that, although the efficient acquisition of a particular element requires a specific set of root traits, suites of traits can be identified that benefit the acquisition of a group of mineral elements. Elements can be divided into three Groups based on common trait requirements. Group 1 comprises N, S, K, B, and P. Group 2 comprises Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, and Ni. Group 3 contains mineral elements that rarely affect crop production. It is argued that breeding for a limited number of distinct root ideotypes, addressing particular combinations of mineral imbalances, should be pursued.},

abstract = {Seeds of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) were used to assess effects of imbibitional temperatures on germination, radicle length, emergence, and development of respiratory activity. Germination in soil after 6 days at 25, 20 and 15°C was about 90\%. Seeds at 10°C for the first 24 hours, and then at 25°C (10/25°C) also germinated about 90\%. However, seeds held continuously at 10°C absorbed sufficient moisture, but failed to germinate within 5 days. Rates of germination and radicle elongation increased when temperature increased from 15 to 25°C. Radicle elongation was slower and emergence was later for seedlings at 10/25°C than that for seeds imbibed and grown throughout at 25°C. In contrast to radicle elongation at 10/25°C was intermediate between that at 15 and 20°C, percentage emergence at 10/25°C was intermediate between 20 and 25°C. These results suggested that radicle growth was more sensitive to imbibitional chilling than was growth of the coleoptile and epicotyl. Respiration rates during imbibition at 10 and 6°C were low, and increased slowly in a linear manner over time as seeds imbibed water. Respiration rates at the higher inbibitional temperatures were progressively higher, and increased in a curvilinear manner as water was imbibed. Seeds at 31\% moisture had respiration rates of 186, 83, 57, 22, and 10 $\mu$l O2 h−1 g−1 for the 25, 20, 15, 10, and 6°C treatments, respectively. Although seeds imbibed water at 6 and 10°C reaching the moisture content necessary for germination, they did not germinate.},

The relationship of biological yield, grain yield, and harvest index to each other and to other plant characteristics is discussed. Various models and actual relationships between biological yields and grain yields within a series of genotypes or agronomic treatments are described. The situation in which a number of varieties have precisely the same biological yield but different grain yields is graphically presented along with the genotypes that are ranked in order of increasing grain yield. Grain yield is proportional to harvest index and their correlation is 1.00, whereas biological yield and harvest index are unrelated. The chapter examines the interaction of biological yield, grain yield, and harvest index with plant density. Biological yield and harvest index are two valuable criteria for the assessment of the performance of cereals.},

abstract = {Leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinase (RLK) proteins play key roles in a variety of biological pathways. In a previous study, we analyzed the members of the rice LRR-RLK gene family using in silico analysis. A total of 23 LRR-RLK genes were selected based on the expression patterns of a genome-wide dataset of microarrays. The Oryza sativa gamma-ray induced LRR-RLK1 (OsGIRL1) gene was highly induced by gamma irradiation. Therefore, we studied its expression pattern in response to various different abiotic and phytohormone treatments. OsGIRL1 was induced on exposure to abiotic stresses such as salt, osmotic, and heat, salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA), but exhibited downregulation in response to jasmonic acid (JA) treatment. The OsGIRL1 protein was clearly localized at the plasma membrane. The truncated proteins harboring juxtamembrane and kinase domains (or only harboring a kinase domain) exhibited strong autophosphorylation. The biological function of OsGIRL1 was investigated via heterologous overexpression of this gene in Arabidopsis plants subjected to gamma-ray irradiation, salt stress, osmotic stress, and heat stress. A hypersensitive response was observed in response to salt stress and heat stress, whereas a hyposensitive response was observed in response to gamma-ray treatment and osmotic stress. These results provide critical insights into the molecular functions of the rice LRR-RLK genes as receptors of external signals.},

abstract = {Breeding for drought tolerance in grain crops is not a generic issue. Periods of drought vary in length, timing and intensity and different traits are important with different types of drought. The search for generic drought tolerance using single-gene transformations has been disappointing. It has typically concentrated on survival of plants suffering from severe water stress, which is rarely an important trait in crops. More promising approaches that target complex traits tailored to specific requirements at the different main stages of the life of a crop, during: establishment, vegetative development, floral development and grain growth are outlined. The challenge is to devise inexpensive and effective ways of identifying promising phenotypes with the aim of aligning them with genomic information to identify molecular markers useful to breeders. Controlled environments offer the stability to search for attractive phenotypes or genotypes in a specific type of drought.The recent availability of robots for measuring large number of plantsmeans that large numbers of genotypes can be readily phenotyped. However, controlled environments differ greatly from those in the field. Devising pot experiments that cater for important yield-determining processes in the field is difficult, especially when water is limiting. Thus, breeders are unlikely to takemuch notice of research in controlled environments unless the worth of specific traits has been demonstrated in the field. An essential link in translating laboratory research to the field is the development of novel genotypes that incorporate gene(s) expressing a promising trait into breeding lines that are adapted to target field environments. Only if the novel genotypes perform well in the field are they likely to gain the interest of breeders. High throughput phenotyping will play a pivotal role in this process. Additional},

@article{Miedes2011,
abstract = {Transgenic tomato hypocotyls with altered levels of an XTH gene were used to study how XET activity could affect the hypocotyl growth and cell wall extensibility. Transgenic hypocotyls showed significant over-expression (line 13) or co-suppression (line 33) of the SlXTH1 in comparison with the wild type, with these results being correlated with the results on specific soluble XET activity, suggesting that SlXTH1 translates mainly for a soluble XET isoenzyme. A relationship between XET activity and cell wall extensibility was found, and the highest total extensibility was located in the apical hypocotyl segment of the over-expressing SlXTH1 line, where the XET-specific activity and hypocotyl growth were also highest compared with the wild line. Also, in the co-suppression SlXTH1 line, total extensibility values were lower than in the wild type line. The study of linkages between cell wall polysaccharides by FTIR showed that hypocotyls over-expressing SlXTH1 and having a higher XET-specific activity, were grouped away from the wild line, indicating that the linkages between pectins and between cellulose and xyloglucans might differ. These results suggested that the action of the increased XET activity in the transgenic line could be responsible for the cell wall structural changes, and therefore, alter the cell wall extensibility. On the other hand, results on xyloglucan oligosaccharides composition of the xyloglucan by MALDI TOF-MS showed no differences between lines, indicating that the xyloglucan structure was not affected by the XET action. These results provide evidences that XTHs from group I are involved mainly in the restructuring of the cell wall during growth and development, but they are not the limiting factor for plant growth.},

abstract = {Chlorophyll fluorescence transient from initial to maximum fluorescence ("P" step) throughout two intermediate steps ("J" and "I") (JIP-test) is considered a reliable early quantitative indicator of stress in plants. The JIP-test is particularly useful for crop plants when applied in variable field environments. The aim of the present study was to conduct a quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for nine JIP-test parameters in maize during flowering in four field environments differing in weather conditions. QTL analysis and identification of putative candidate genes might help to explain the genetic relationship between photosynthesis and different field scenarios in maize plants. The JIP-test parameters were analyzed in the intermated B73 × Mo17 (IBM) maize population of 205 recombinant inbred lines. A set of 2,178 molecular markers across the whole maize genome was used for QTL analysis revealing 10 significant QTLs for seven JIP-test parameters, of which five were co-localized when combined over the four environments indicating polygenic inheritance and pleiotropy. Our results demonstrate that QTL analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence parameters was capable of detecting one pleiotropic locus on chromosome 7, coinciding with the gene gst23 that may be associated with efficient photosynthesis under different field scenarios.},

abstract = {Variation in transpiration efficiency (TE) and its relationship with the stable carbon isotope ratio of wood was investigated in the saplings of three tropical tree species. Five individuals each of Platymiscium pinnatum (Jacq.) Dugand, Swietenia macrophylla King and Tectona grandis Linn. f. were grown individually in large (760 l) pots over 16 months in the Republic of Panama. Cumulative transpiration was determined by repeatedly weighing the pots with a pallet truck scale. Dry matter production was determined by destructive harvest. The TE, expressed as experiment-long dry matter production divided by cumulative water use, averaged 4.1, 4.3 and 2.9 g dry matter kg(-1) water for P. pinnatum, S. macrophylla and T. grandis, respectively. The TE of T. grandis was significantly lower than that of the other two species. Instantaneous measurements of the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO(2) partial pressures (c(i)/c(a)), taken near the end of the experiment, explained 66\% of variation in TE. Stomatal conductance was lower in S. macrophylla than in T. grandis, whereas P. pinnatum had similar stomatal conductance to T. grandis, but with a higher photosynthetic rate. Thus, c(i)/c(a) and TE appeared to vary in response to both stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity. Stem-wood delta(13)C varied over a relatively narrow range of just 2.2 per thousand, but still explained 28\% of variation in TE. The results suggest that leaf-level processes largely determined variation among the three tropical tree species in whole-plant water-use efficiency integrated over a full annual cycle.},

abstract = {Environmental light information such as quality, intensity, and duration in red (∼660 nm) and far-red (∼730 nm) wavelengths is perceived by phytochrome photoreceptors in plants, critically influencing almost all developmental strategies from germination to flowering. Phytochromes interconvert between red light-absorbing Pr and biologically functional far-red light-absorbing Pfr forms. To ensure optimal photoresponses in plants, the flux of light signal from Pfr-phytochromes should be tightly controlled. Phytochromes are phosphorylated at specific serine residues. We found that a type 5 protein phosphatase (PAPP5) specifically dephosphorylates biologically active Pfr-phytochromes and enhances phytochrome-mediated photoresponses. Depending on the specific serine residues dephosphorylated by PAPP5, phytochrome stability and affinity for a downstream signal transducer, NDPK2, were enhanced. Thus, phytochrome photoreceptors have developed an elaborate biochemical tuning mechanism for modulating the flux of light signal, employing variable phosphorylation states controlled by phosphorylation and PAPP5-mediated dephosphorylation as a mean to control phytochrome stability and affinity for downstream transducers.},

@article{Yang2006a,
abstract = {The chloroplast HSP100/ClpB is a newly documented member of the ClpB family, but little was known about its role in imparting thermotolerance to cells. A cDNA coding for a HSP100/ClpB homolog has been cloned from Lycopersicon esculentum and termed as Lehsp100/ClpB (the cDNA sequence of Lehsp100/ClpB has been submitted to the GenBank database under accession number: AB219939). The protein encoded by the cDNA was most similar to the putative chloroplast HSP100/ClpBs in higher plants and the ClpB from Cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. A 97 kDa protein, which matched the predicted size of mature LeHSP100/ClpB, was immunologically detected in chloroplast isolated from heat-treated tomato plants. In addition, the fusion protein, combining the transit sequence of LeHSP100/ClpB and GFP, was found to be located in chloroplast based on the observations of fluorescent microscope images. These results indicated the chloroplast-localization of LeHSP100/ClpB. Both the transcript and the protein of Lehsp100/ClpB were not detected under normal growth conditions, but they were induced by increasingly higher temperatures. An antisense Lehsp100/ClpB cDNA fragment was introduced into the tomato by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Antisense lines exhibited an extreme repression of heat-induced expression of Lehsp100/ClpB. The levels of chloroplast HSP60 and small HSP in antisense lines were identical to those of the control plants. After plants preconditioned at 38 degrees C for 2 h were exposed to a lethal heat shock at 46 degrees C for 2 h, the antisense lines were greatly impaired and withered in 21 days of the recovery phase, whereas the untransformed control plants and the vector-transformed plants survived. Furthermore, chlorophyll fluorescence measurements showed that PS II in antisense lines were more susceptible to the thermal irreversible inactivation than the untransformed and vector-transformed control plants. This work provides the first example that induction of chloroplast LeHSP100/ClpB contributes to the acquisition of thermotolerance in higher plants.},

Increasing sucrose concentrations were found to promote cell growth and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in grape cell cultures obtained from cv. Barbera immature berries. This led to an intracellular accumulation and/or release into the media of specific polyphenol families (in particular, anthocyanins, catechins and stilbenes). This effect was partially correlated with a sucrose modulation of the transcription of some key biosynthetic enzymes, such as phenylalanine ammonia lyase, chalcone synthase, chalcone-flavanone isomerase and stilbene synthase. Total catechin amounts, both endogenous and released in the media, were increased in proportion to the sugar concentration, as were anthocyanin and stilbene production. Sugar treatment notably improved the endogenous accumulation and release in the culture media of resveratroloside, a resveratrol mono-glycoside, which is the most abundant stilbene found in grape cultures, especially in cv. Barbera. We hypothesize that high sucrose concentrations (exceeding those naturally-occurring in ripe berries) could play a role in plant defense via the induction of secondary metabolites, such as stilbenes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The estimation of chlorophyll content in leaves by the chlorophyll meter (SPAD 502) is more convenient than by the extraction method for studies on photosynthesis or senescence where the total chlorophyll is estimated on the same leaf over time. This study was to test hypothesis that specific leaf weight (SLW) appears to be one of the factors determining SPAD index under different conditions. The influence of SLW on SPAD index and an improved simple method to determine chlorophyll content of sorghum and pigeonpea by a chlorophyll meter was studied. The results indicated that regression lines were significantly different between sorghum and pigeonpea, and at the vegetative and physiological maturity stages in each crop. Residuals of simple regressions calculated from all data of each crop were correlated with SLW. Multiple-regression with SPAD index as the dependent variable, and chlorophyll content and SLW as the independent variables gave the best estimation of chlorophyll content in leaves of sorghum and pigeonpea. These results suggest that SLW is an important factor affecting SPAD index and the influence of SLW on SPAD index can vary with crop species. Devices for estimating SLW could be incorporated into the chlorophyll meter to provide SPAD values adjusted for SLW. Further investigation is required on the influence of SLW on SPAD index for other crops.},

abstract = {We recently isolated two genes (OsGA3ox1 and OsGA3ox2) from rice (Oryza sativa) encoding 3beta-hydroxylase, which catalyzes the final step of active gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis (H. Itoh, M. Ueguchi-Tanaka, N. Sentoku, H. Kitano, M. Matsuoka, M. Kobayashi [2001] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98: 8909-8914). Using these cloned cDNAs, we analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of the 3beta-hydroxylase genes and also an alpha-amylase gene (RAmy1A) during rice seed germination to investigate the relationship between GA biosynthesis and alpha-amylase expression. Northern-blot analyses revealed that RAmy1A expression in the embryo occurs before the induction of 3beta-hydroxylase expression, whereas in the endosperm, a high level of RAmy1A expression occurs 1 to 2 d after the peak of OsGA3ox2 expression and only in the absence of uniconazol. Based on the analysis of an OsGA3ox2 null mutant (d18-Akibare dwarf), we determined that 3beta-hydroxylase produced by OsGA3ox2 is important for the induction of RAmy1A expression and that the OsGA3ox1 product is not essential for alpha-amylase induction. The expression of OsGA3ox2 was localized to the shoot region and epithelium of the embryo, strongly suggesting that active GA biosynthesis occurs in these two regions. The synthesis of active GA in the epithelium is important for alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm, because an embryonic mutant defective in shoot formation, but which developed epithelium cells, induced alpha-amylase expression in the endosperm, whereas a mutant defective in epithelium development did not.},

abstract = {When pea embryos are placed in water solutes leak from them at a rate which declines rapidly at first and then more slowly. Embryos can be dried down over calcium chloride and will then leak as before when returned to water. Similar results were obtained with Ricinus seeds after removal of the testa.  Pea embryos that have first been allowed to imbibe some water through a small part of their surface (by placing them on damp filter-paper) leak relatively slowly when subsequently immersed in water; the greater the initial imbibition the slower the subsequent leakage. Likewise, embryos taken from peas that were harvested when succulent and tender show only slow leakage  It is proposed that as seeds dry out in the course of development cell membranes lose their integrity. When such dry seeds are allowed to imbibe water there is a short period, before membrane integrity is re-established, during which solutes can leak out of the cells.},

abstract = {Osmotic adjustment occurred during drought in expanded leaves of sunflowers (Helianthus annuus var Hysun 30) which had been continuously exposed to 660 microliters CO(2) per liter or had been previously acclimated to drought. The effect was greatest when the treatments were combined and was negligible in nonacclimated plants grown at 340 microliters CO(2) per liter. The concentrations of ethanol soluble sugars and potassium increased during drought but they did not account for the osmotic adjustment. The delay in the decline in conductance and relative water content and in the loss of structural integrity with increasing drought was dependent on the degree of osmotic adjustment. Where it was greatest, conductance fell from 5.8 millimeters per second on the first day of drought to 1.3 millimeters per second on the fourth day and was at approximately the same level on the eighth day. The relative water content remained constant at 85\% for three days and fell to 36\% on the sixth day. There was no evidence of leaf desiccation even on the eighth day. In contrast, the conductance of leaves showing minimal adjustment fell rapidly after the first day of drought and was negligible after the fourth, at which time the relative water content was 36\%. By the sixth day of drought, areas near the margins of the leaves were desiccating and the plants did not recover upon rewatering. Despite the differences in the rate of change of conductance and relative water content during drought, photosynthetic electron transport activity, inferred from measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence in vivo and PSII activity of isolated thylakoids, remained functional until desiccation occurred.},

abstract = {We have previously identified GAMYB, a gibberellin (GA)-regulated transcriptional activator of alpha-amylase gene expression, in aleurone cells of barley (Hordeum vulgare). To examine the regulation of GAMYB expression, we describe the use of nuclear run-on experiments to show that GA causes a 2-fold increase in the rate of GAMYB transcription and that the effect of GA can be blocked by abscisic acid (ABA). To identify GA-signaling components that regulate GAMYB expression, we examined the role of SLN1, a negative regulator of GA signaling in barley. SLN1, which is the product of the Sln1 (Slender1) locus, is necessary for repression of GAMYB in barley aleurone cells. The activity of SLN1 in aleurone cells is regulated posttranslationally. SLN1 protein levels decline rapidly in response to GA before any increase in GAMYB levels. Green fluorescent protein-SLN1 fusion protein was targeted to the nucleus of aleurone protoplasts and disappeared in response to GA. Evidence from a dominant dwarf mutant at Sln1, and from the gse1 mutant (that affects GA "sensitivity"), indicates that GA acts by regulating SLN1 degradation and not translation. Mutation of the DELLA region of SLN1 results in increased protein stability in GA-treated layers, indicating that the DELLA region plays an important role in GA-induced degradation of SLN1. Unlike GA, ABA had no effect on SLN1 stability, confirming that ABA acts downstream of SLN1 to block GA signaling.},

@article{Koizumi2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Imbibition of Japanese soybean (Glycine max) cultivars was studied using micro-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in order to elucidate the mechanism of soaking injury and the protective role of the seed coat.

METHODS: Time-lapse images during water uptake were acquired by the single-point imaging (SPI) method at 15-min intervals, for 20 h in the dry seed with seed coat, and for 2 h in seeds with the seed coat removed. The technique visualized water migration within the testa and demonstrated the distortion associated with cotyledon swelling during the very early stages of water uptake.

KEY RESULTS: Water soon appeared in the testa and went around the dorsal surface of the seed from near the raphe, then migrated to the hilum region. An obvious protrusion was noted when water reached the hypocotyl and the radicle, followed by swelling of the cotyledons. A convex area was observed around the raphe with the enlargement of the seed. Water was always incorporated into the cotyledons from the abaxial surfaces, leading to swelling and generating a large air space between the adaxial surfaces. Water uptake greatly slowed, and the internal structures, veins and oil-accumulating tissues in the cotyledons developed after the seed stopped expanding. When the testa was removed from the dry seeds before imbibition, the cotyledons were severely damaged within 1.5 h of water uptake.

CONCLUSIONS: The activation of the water channel seemed unnecessary for water entry into soybean seeds, and the testa rapidly swelled with steeping in water. However, the testa did not regulate the water incorporation in itself, but rather the rate at which water encountered the hypocotyl, the radicle, and the cotyledons through the inner layer of the seed coat, and thus prevented the destruction of the seed tissues at the beginning of imbibition.},

To achieve meaningful results, these approaches must be linked with suitable phenotyping protocols at all stages, such as the screening of germplasm collections, mutant libraries, mapping populations, transgenic lines and breeding materials and the design of OMICS and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) experiments. Here we present a conceptual framework for molecular breeding for drought tolerance based on the Passioura equation of expressing yield as the product of water use (WU), water use efficiency (WUE) and harvest index (HI). We identify phenotyping protocols that address each of these factors, describe their key features and illustrate their integration with different molecular approaches.},

abstract = {The effect of drought on the photosynthetic apparatus of leaves of Salix sp. was studied by measurements of the induction of chlorophyll fluorescence and the capacity for O(2) evolution. Using a multivariate analysis, a model was developed that could predict the degree of drought stress from the data of fluorescence kinetics. Even mild drought stress was detected with high precision; this was not always possible when the photosynthetic capacity was measured. The most clear discrimination between control and drought-stressed leaves was obtained if fluorescence induction was measured at high rather than normal CO(2) levels, and at low rather than high light levels. All information provided by fluorescence pertaining to drought was contained within the slow phase of the induction curve. It is suggested that rapid dehydration is different from drought at the mechanistic level as judged by the fluorescence characteristics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Jatropha curcas is a drought-resistant tree whose seeds are a good source of oil that can be used for producing biodiesel. A successful crop establishment depends on a rapid and uniform germination of the seed. In this work we aimed to characterize the responses of J. curcas seeds to temperature and water availability, using thermal time and hydrotime analysis,$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Thermal and hydrotime analysis was performed on germination data obtained from the incubation of seeds at different temperatures and at different water potentials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Base and optimum temperatures were 14·4 and 30 °C, respectively. Approximately 20 \% of the seed population displayed absolute dormancy and part of it displayed relative dormancy which was progressively expressed in further fractions when incubation temperatures departed from 25 °C. The thermal time model, but not the hydrotime model, failed to describe adequately final germination percentages at temperatures other than 25 °C. The hydrotime constant, $\theta$(H), was reduced when the incubation temperature was increased up to 30 °C, the base water potential for 50 \% germination,$\Psi$(b(50)), was less negative at 20 and 30 °C than at 25 °C, indicating either expression or induction of dormancy. At 20 °C this less negative $\Psi$(b(50)) explained satisfactorily the germination curves obtained at all water potentials, while at 30 °C it had to be corrected towards even less negative values to match observed curves at water potentials below 0. Hence, $\Psi$(b(50)) appeared to have been further displaced to less negative values as exposure to 30 °C was prolonged by osmoticum. These results suggest expression of dormancy at 20 °C and induction of secondary dormancy above 25 °C. This was confirmed by an experiment showing that inhibition of germination imposed by temperatures higher than 30 °C, but not that imposed at 20 °C, is a permanent effect.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: This study revealed (a) the extremely narrow thermal range within which dormancy problems (either through expression or induction of dormancy) may not be encountered; and (b) the high sensitivity displayed by these seeds to water shortage. In addition, this work is the first one in which temperature effects on dormancy expression could be discriminated from those on dormancy induction using a hydrotime analysis.},

@article{Alia1999,
abstract = {Arabidopsis thaliana was transformed with the codA gene from Arthrobacter globiformis. This gene encodes choline oxidase, an enzyme that converts choline to glycinebetaine. The photosynthetic activity, monitored in terms of chlorophyll fluorescence, of transformed plants was more tolerant to light stress than that of wild-type plants. This enhanced tolerance to light stress was caused by acceleration of the recovery of the photosystem II (PS II) complex from the photo-inactivated state. The transformed plants synthesized glycinebetaine, but no changes were detected in the relative levels of membrane lipids or in the relative levels of fatty acids in the various membrane lipids. Transformation with the codA gene increased levels of H2O2, a by-product of the reaction catalyzed by choline oxidase, by only 50\% to 100\% under stress or non-stress conditions. The activity of ascorbate peroxidase and, to a lesser extent, that of catalase in transformed plants were significantly higher than in the wild-type plants. These observations suggest that H2O2 produced by choline oxidase in the transformed plants might have stimulated the expression of H2O2 scavenging enzymes, with resultant maintenance of the level of H2O2 within a certain limited range. It appears that glycinebetaine produced in vivo, but not changes in membrane lipids or in the level of H2O2, protected the PS II complex in transformed plants from damage due to light stress.},

abstract = {Plants of lettuce were subjected to four abiotic limiting growing conditions, i.e. no phosphorus fertilization (0\_P), no nitrogen fertilization (0\_N), limitation of the photosynthetic active radiation (PAR, range from 400 to 700nm) (LR) and water availability constraint (WR). Yield, yield components, root growth, bound and soluble phenolic compounds accumulation and their antiradical activity were investigated. Leaf length decreased by 21\% in 0\_N while increased by 57\% in LR with respect to CONTROL plants. Yield reduced by 74\% and 57\% in 0\_N and WR, respectively, which also induced a reduction in roots FW, resulting in a significant increase in roots/leaves ratio (0.47 and 0.33 for 0\_N and WR, respectively). Conversely, LR favoured the highest leaves fresh weight (FW) (99.89gplant−1) and the lowest root biomass FW (7.50gplant−1); consequently, the roots/leaves ratio was strongly constrained (0.07). The limitation of PAR availability reduced both soluble and bound phenolic compounds as well as antiradical activity. 0\_N allowed to obtain the highest total polyphenols content (4.27mg GAEg−1 FW) and antiradical activity (13.91$\mu$mol TEg−1 FW), although no differences were found in terms of the main phenolic compounds. WR improved the accumulation of caffeic, caftaric and chicoric acids in the bound forms (0.64, 300.85 and 67.38mg 100g−1 FW, respectively). PCA analysis significantly explored the correlation between the limiting growing conditions with lettuce yield and quality traits and indicated that water and N fertilization management as the more effective to manipulate the accumulation of plant-based phytochemicals which play an important role in human well-being.},

@article{Kholova2010,
abstract = {It was previously shown that pearl millet genotypes carrying a terminal drought tolerance quantitative trait locus (QTL) had a lower transpiration rate (Tr; g cm(-2) d(-1)) under well-watered conditions than sensitive lines. Here experiments were carried out to test whether this relates to leaf abscisic acid (ABA) and Tr concentration at high vapour pressure deficit (VPD), and whether that leads to transpiration efficiency (TE) differences. These traits were measured in tolerant/sensitive pearl millet genotypes, including near-isogenic lines introgressed with a terminal drought tolerance QTL (NIL-QTLs). Most genotypic differences were found under well-watered conditions. ABA levels under well-watered conditions were higher in tolerant genotypes, including NIL-QTLs, than in sensitive genotypes, and ABA did not increase under water stress. Well-watered Tr was lower in tolerant than in sensitive genotypes at all VPD levels. Except for one line, Tr slowed down in tolerant lines above a breakpoint at 1.40-1.90 kPa, with the slope decreasing >50\%, whereas sensitive lines showed no change in that Tr response across the whole VPD range. It is concluded that two water-saving (avoidance) mechanisms may operate under well-watered conditions in tolerant pearl millet: (i) a low Tr even at low VPD conditions, which may relate to leaf ABA; and (ii) a sensitivity to higher VPD that further restricts Tr, which suggests the involvement of hydraulic signals. Both traits, which did not lead to TE differences, could contribute to absolute water saving seen in part due to dry weight increase differences. This water saved would become critical for grain filling and deserves consideration in the breeding of terminal drought-tolerant lines.},

@article{Pinior2005,
abstract = {Micropropagated rose plants (Rosa hybrida L., cv. New Dawn) were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices (Schenk and Smith) and subjected to different drought regimens. The dual objectives of these experiments were to investigate the mechanism and the extent to which AM can prevent drought damages and whether physiological analyses reveal enhanced drought tolerance of an economically important plant such as the rose. In a long-term drought experiment with four different water regimens, visual scoring of wilt symptoms affirmed that AM in a selected host-symbiont combination increased plant performance. This effect was mostly expressed if moderate drought stress was constantly applied over a long period. In a short-term experiment in which severe drought stress was implemented and plants were allowed to recover after 4 or 9 days, no visual differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal roses were observed. Therefore, the early physiological steps conferring drought tolerance were prone to investigation. Proline content in leaves proved to be an unsuitable marker for AM-induced drought tolerance, whereas analysis of chlorophyll a fluorescence using the JIP test (collecting stress-induced changes of the polyphasic O-J-I-P fluorescence kinetics in a non-destructive tissue screening) was more explanatory. Parameters derived from this test could describe the extent of foliar stress response and help to differentiate physiological mechanisms of stress tolerance. AM led to a more intense electron flow and a higher productive photosynthetic activity at several sites of the photosynthetic electron transport chain. A K step, known as a stress indicator of general character, appeared in the fluorescence transient only in drought-stressed non-mycorrhizal plants; conversely, the data elucidate a stabilising effect of AM on the oxygen-evolving complex at the donor site of photosystem (PS) II and at the electron-transport chain between PS II and PS I. If drought stress intensity was reduced by a prolonged and milder drying phase, these significant tolerance features were less pronounced or missing, indicating a possible threshold level for mycorrhizal tolerance induction.},

abstract = {The common Soil in Egypt is clay soil so common irrigation system is tradition surface irrigation with 60\% irrigation efficiency. Agricultural sector consumes more than 80\% of water resources under surface irrigation (tradition methods). In arid and semi-arid regions consumptive use is the best index for irrigation requirements. A large part of the irrigation water applied to farm land is consumed by Evapotranspiration (ET). Irrigation water consumption under each of the physical and climatic conditions for large scale will be easier with remote sensing techniques. In Egypt, Agricultural cycle is often tow agricultural seasons yearly; summer and winter. Common summer crops are Maize, Rice and Cotton while common winter crops are Clover and Wheat. Landsat8 bands 4 and 5 provide Red (R) and Near Infra-Red (NIR) measurements and it used to calculate Normalized Deference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and monitoring cultivated areas. The cultivated land area was 3,277,311 ha in August 2013. In this paper Kc = 2 * NDVI − 0.2 represents the relation between crop coefficient (Kc) and NDVI. Kc and Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) used to estimate ETc in Egypt. The main objective of this paper is studying the potential crop Evapotranspiration in Egypt using remote sensing techniques.},

abstract = {This study was conducted over a period of 20 years, to assess the problems involved in developing subcultures over a very long period, of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) somatic embryos which were maintained in vitro on a Murashige and Skoog mineral-based culture medium, without growth regulators. Analysis of the proliferation rate of the embryogenic cultures, along with the survivability of the regenerated plantlets after their transfer into soil and of the flowering of the derived adult palms has been conducted for cultures maintained in vitro during 1 to 20 years. From the ninth year of maintenance, the tissue quality of the somatic embryos gradually began to decline. However, after more than 20 years, 30\% of the 20 clones tested still continued to proliferate satisfactorily on the same maintenance medium, keeping their multiplication potential intact. Even though a depressive effect of the age of the lines has been observed on the survival capacity of plants under natural conditions, it is noteworthy that among the clones originating from 20-year-old cultures only eight of them (40\%) have exhibited the "mantled" floral abnormality. Different hypotheses concerning the origin of the disruptions observed on the in vitro cultures, plantlets and adult palms that occur over a very long period of in vitro conservation are discussed.},

@article{Liu2006a,
abstract = {The physiological responses of potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Folva) to partial root-zone drying (PRD) were investigated in potted plants in a greenhouse (GH) and in plants grown in the field under an automatic rain-out-shelter. In the GH, irrigation was applied daily to the whole root system (FI), or to one-half of the root system while the other half was dried, for 9 d. In the field, the plants were drip irrigated either to the whole root system near field capacity (FI) or using 70\% water of FI to one side of the roots, and shifted to the other side every 5-10 d (PRD). PRD plants had a similar midday leaf water potential to that of FI, whereas in the GH their root water potential (Psi(r)) was significantly lowered after 5 d. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was more sensitive to PRD than photosynthesis (A) particularly in the field, leading to greater intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE) (i.e. A/g(s)) in PRD than in FI plants on several days. In PRD, the xylem sap abscisic acid concentration ([ABA](xylem)) increased exponentially with decreasing Psi(r); and the relative [ABA](xylem) (PRD/FI) increased exponentially as the fraction of transpirable soil water (FTSW) in the drying side decreased. In the field, the leaf area index was slightly less in PRD than in FI treatment, while tuber biomass was similar for the two treatments. Compared with FI, PRD treatment saved 30\% water and increased crop water use efficiency (WUE) by 59\%. Restrictions on leaf area expansion and g(s) by PRD-induced ABA signals might have contributed to reduced water use and increased WUE.},

abstract = {Accumulation of compatible solutes is considered a key adaptation mechanism in many plants in response to abiotic stress. The expression of four genes, involved in sucrose metabolism (SPS and SuSy), biosynthesis of galactinol (GoLS1) and proline accumulation (P5CS) was compared: at meiosis (MM), vacuolated and mature stages of pollen development in heat tolerant and heat sensitive tomato genotypes. The results showed differences in gene expression across tomato genotypes and stages of pollen development. Three genes (P5CS, SPS and SuSy) were up regulated in heat tolerant genotype CLN1621L at the mature stage and one gene (P5CS) in genotype CLN5915-93D at the MM stage. Two genes (SPS and GoLS1) were down regulated in heat sensitive genotype CA4 and one gene (GoLS1) in genotype CLN2498E at the MM stage. Additionally, the continuous exposure of tomato genotypes to temperatures of 35°C/28°C day/night completely impaired flower development in genotypes CA4 and CLN2498E but not in genotypes CLN1621L and CLN5915-93D. Tomato genotypes CLN1621L and CLN5915-93D produced fully developed flowers containing mixture of non viable pollens and very few viable pollens grains. Membrane permeability was affected at all stages of development under heat stress with heat tolerant genotypes CL5915-93D4, CLN2498E and CLN1621L showing varying degrees of heat acclimation. Significant increases in total chlorophyll were seen in all genotypes in response to heat stress.

abstract = {To increase crop yield per unit of scarce water requires both better cultivars and better agronomy. The challenge is to manage the crop or improve its genetic makeup to: capture more of the water supply for use in transpiration; exchange transpired water for CO2 more effectively in producing biomass; and convert more of the biomass into grain or other harvestable product. In the field, the upper limit of water productivity of well-managed disease-free water-limited cereal crops is typically 20 kg ha -1 mm-1 (grain yield per water used). If the productivity is markedly less than this, it is likely that major stresses other than water are at work, such as weeds, diseases, poor nutrition, or inhospitable soil. If so, the greatest advances will come from dealing with these first. When water is the predominant limitation, there is scope for improving overall water productivity by better matching the development of the crop to the pattern of water supply, thereby reducing evaporative and other losses and fostering a good balance of water-use before and after flowering, which is needed to give a large harvest index. There is also scope for developing genotypes that are able to maintain adequate floret fertility despite any transient severe water deficits during floral development. Marker-assisted selection has helped in controlling some root diseases that limit water uptake, and in maintaining fertility in water-stressed maize. Apart from herbicide-resistance in crops, which helps reduce competition for water by weeds, there are no genetic transformations in the immediate offing that are likely to improve water productivity greatly. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most traits associated with drought tolerance have a dual effect, positive in very severe scenarios and negative in milder scenarios, or the opposite trend. Their effects also depend on other climatic conditions such as evaporative demand or light, and on management practices. This is the case for processes associated with cell protection and with avoidance, but also for the maintenance of growth or photosynthesis, high water use efficiency, large root systems or reduced abortion rate under water deficit. Therefore, spectacular results obtained in one drought scenario may have a limited interest for improving food security in other geographical areas with water scarcity. The most relevant questions on drought tolerance are probably, 'Does a given allele confer a positive effect on yield in an appreciable proportion of years/scenarios in a given area or target population of environment (TPE)?'; 'In a given site or TPE, what is the trade-off between risk avoidance and maintained performance?'; and 'Will a given allele or trait have an increasingly positive effect with climate change?' Considerable progress has already occurred in drought tolerance. Nevertheless, explicitly associating traits for tolerance to drought scenarios may have profound consequences on the genetic strategies, with a necessary involvement of modelling.},

abstract = {A need exists for the development of rapid seed quality tests that determine viability (defined as the ability to germinate) without the necessity for completion of germination. In cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata L.) the compound sinapine, a choline ester of sinapic acid, has been shown to leak from heat-killed (HK.) but not from viable seeds. Sinapine leakage was studied as a more accurate method for identifying viable seeds than the conductivity test. After an 8 h soak, a 26-fold difference in sinapine leakage was detected between HK and viable seeds (as measured by the absorbance at 388 nm at pH 12) compared to a 4-fold difference measured by electrolyte leakage. The remainder of the studies were conducted on two seedlots of the same cultivar. Viability was predicted on the same seed by assessing leakage from individual seeds into the soak water using three methods; soak water colour, absorbance at 388 nm, and electrical conductivity. This information was compared with the actual germination of each seed for the two seedlots. For both seedlots, the presence of sinapine in seed soak water (detected either by a yellow solution colour at high pH or by high absorbance), identified more seeds that were non-viable than the partition coefficient calculated from conductivity measurements (76\%, 72\% and 28\% of non-viable seeds were identified, respectively). It is proposed that leakage of sinapine is a better predictor of cabbage seed viability than electrical conductivity.},

abstract = {The regulation of electron transport between photosystems II and I was investigated in the plant Silene dioica L. by means of measurement of the kinetics of reduction of P(700) following a light-to-dark transition. It was found that, in this species, the rate constant for P(700) reduction is sensitive to light intensity and to the availability of CO(2). The results indicated that at 25 degrees C the rate of electron transport is down-regulated by approximately 40-50\% relative to the maximum rate achievable in saturating CO(2) and that this down-regulation can be explained by regulation of the electron transport chain itself. Measurements of the temperature sensitivity of this rate constant indicated that there is a switch in the rate-limiting step that controls electron transport at around 20 degrees C: at higher temperatures, CO(2) availability is limiting; at lower temperatures some other process regulates electron transport, possibly a diffusion step within the electron transport chain itself. Regulation of electron transport also occurred in response to drought stress and sucrose feeding. Measurements of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence did not support the idea that electron transport is regulated by the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane, and the possibility is discussed that the redox potential of a stromal component may regulate electron transport.Keywords: DeltapH.

Bintje) were grown in open-top chambers (OTCs) under three CO(2) levels (ambient and 24 h d(-1) seasonal mean concentrations of 550 and 680 micromol mol(-1)) and two O(3) levels (ambient and a seasonal mean 8 h d(-1) concentration of 50 nmol mol(-1)). The objectives were to determine the effects of season-long exposure to these key climate change gases on gas exchange, leaf thickness and epidermal characteristics. The experimental design also provided an ideal opportunity to examine within-leaf variation in epidermal characteristics at the whole-leaf level. Stomatal and epidermal cell density and stomatal index were measured at specific locations on the youngest fully expanded leaf (centre of lamina, mid-way between tip and base) and representative whole leaves from each treatment. Effects on leaf conductance, assimilation rate and instantaneous transpiration efficiency were determined by infrared gas analysis, while anatomical characteristics were examined using a combination of leaf impressions and thin sections. Exposure to elevated CO(2) or O(3) generally increased leaf thickness, leaf area, stomatal density, and assimilation rate, but reduced leaf conductance. The irregular stomatal distribution within leaves resulted from a combination of uneven differentiation and expansion of the epidermal cells. The results are discussed with reference to sampling protocols and the need to account for within-leaf variation when examining the impact of climate change or other environmental factors on epidermal characteristics.},

An important mechanism by which NO regulates plant development and stress responses is through S-nitrosylation, that is, covalent attachment of NO to cysteine residues to form S-nitrosothiols (SNO). Despite the importance of nitrogen assimilation and NO signalling, it remains largely unknown how these pathways are interconnected. Here we show that SNO signalling suppresses both nitrate uptake and reduction by transporters and reductases, respectively, to fine tune nitrate homeostasis. Moreover, NO derived from nitrate assimilation suppresses the redox enzyme S-nitrosoglutathione Reductase 1 (GSNOR1) by S-nitrosylation, preventing scavenging of S-nitrosoglutathione, a major cellular bio-reservoir of NO. Hence, our data demonstrates that (S)NO controls its own generation and scavenging by modulating nitrate assimilation and GSNOR1 activity.},

abstract = {The regulation of water uptake of germinating tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) seeds was studied spatially and temporally by in vivo (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) microimaging and (1)H-magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy. These nondestructive state-of-the-art methods showed that water distribution in the water uptake phases II and III is inhomogeneous. The micropylar seed end is the major entry point of water. The micropylar endosperm and the radicle show the highest hydration. Germination of tobacco follows a distinct pattern of events: rupture of the testa is followed by rupture of the endosperm. Abscisic acid (ABA) specifically inhibits endosperm rupture and phase III water uptake, but does not alter the spatial and temporal pattern of phase I and II water uptake. Testa rupture was associated with an increase in water uptake due to initial embryo elongation, which was not inhibited by ABA. Overexpression of beta-1,3-glucanase in the seed-covering layers of transgenic tobacco seeds did not alter the moisture sorption isotherms or the spatial pattern of water uptake during imbibition, but partially reverted the ABA inhibition of phase III water uptake and of endosperm rupture. In vivo (13)C-magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy showed that seed oil mobilization is not inhibited by ABA. ABA therefore does not inhibit germination by preventing oil mobilization or by decreasing the water-holding capacity of the micropylar endosperm and the radicle. Our results support the proposal that different seed tissues and organs hydrate at different extents and that the micropylar endosperm region of tobacco acts as a water reservoir for the embryo.},

Desire\'{e}) plants expressing an antisense construct against chloroplastic fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase, EC 3.1.3.11) in response to increasing photon flux densities, different relative air humidities and elevated CO(2) concentrations. Assimilation rates (A) and transpiration rates (E) were observed during a stepwise increase of photon flux density. These experiments were carried out under atmospheric conditions and in air containing 500 micromol mol(-1) CO(2). In both gas atmospheres, two levels of relative air humidity (60-70\% and 70-80\%) were applied in different sets of measurements. Intercellular CO(2) concentration, leaf conductance, air-to-leaf vapour pressure deficit, and instantaneous water-use efficiency (A/E) were determined. As expected, assimilation rates of the FBPase antisense plants were significantly reduced as compared to the wild type. Saturation of assimilation rates in transgenic plants occurred at a photon flux density of 200 micromol m(-2) s(-1), whereas saturation in wild type plants was observed at 600 micromol m(-2) s(-1). Elevated ambient CO(2) levels did not effect assimilation rates of transgenic plants. At 70-80\% relative humidity and atmospheric CO(2) concentration the FBPase antisense plants had significantly higher leaf conductances than wild-type plants while no difference emerged at 60-70\%. These differences in leaf conductance vanished at elevated levels of ambient CO(2). Stomatal response to different relative air humidities was not affected by mesophyll photosynthetic activity. It is suggested that the regulation of stomatal opening upon changes in photon flux density is merely mediated by a signal transmitted from mesophyll cells, whereas the intercellular CO(2) concentration plays a minor role in this kind of stomatal response. The results are discussed with respect to stomatal control by environmental parameters and mesophyll photosynthesis.},

@article{Meyer1998,
abstract = {Imaging of photochemical yield of photosystem II (PSII) computed from leaf chlorophyll fluorescence images and gas-exchange measurements were performed on Rosa rubiginosa leaflets during abscisic acid (ABA) addition. In air ABA induced a decrease of both the net CO2 assimilation (An) and the stomatal water vapor conductance (gs). After ABA treatment, imaging in transient nonphotorespiratory conditions (0.1\% O2) revealed a heterogeneous decrease of PSII photochemical yield. This decline was fully reversed by a transient high CO2 concentration (7400 mol mol-1) in the leaf atmosphere. It was concluded that ABA primarily affected An by decreasing the CO2 supply at ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Therefore, the An versus intercellular mole fraction (Ci) relationship was assumed not to be affected by ABA, and images of Ci and gs were constructed from images of PSII photochemical yield under nonphotorespiratory conditions. The distribution of gs remained unimodal following ABA treatment. A comparison of calculations of Ci from images and gas exchange in ABA-treated leaves showed that the overestimation of Ci estimated from gas exchange was only partly due to heterogeneity. This overestimation was also attributed to the cuticular transpiration, which largely affects the calculation of the leaf conductance to CO2, when leaf conductance to water is low.},

abstract = {In addition to basal defense mechanisms, plants are able to develop enhanced defense mechanisms such as induced resistance (IR) upon appropriate stimulation. We recently described the means by which several carboxylic acids protect Arabidopsis and tomato plants against fungi. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of hexanoic acid (Hx) in the control of Alternaria brown spot (ABS) disease via enhancement of the immune system of Fortune mandarin. The application of 1mM Hx in irrigation water to 2-year-old Fortune plants clearly reduced the incidence of the disease and led to smaller lesions. We observed that several of the most important mechanisms involved in induced resistance were affected by Hx application. Our results demonstrate enhanced callose deposition in infected plants treated with Hx, which suggests an Hx priming mechanism. Plants treated with the callose inhibitor 2-DDG were more susceptible to the fungus. Moreover, polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) gene expression was rapidly and significantly upregulated in treated plants. However, treatment with Hx decreased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in infected plants. Hormonal and gene analyses revealed that the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway was activated due to a greater accumulation of 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA) and JA along with a rapid accumulation of JA-isoleucine (JA-Ile). Furthermore, we observed a more rapid accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA), which could act as a positive regulator of callose deposition. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that both enhanced physical barriers and the JA signaling pathway are involved in hexanoic acid-induced resistance (Hx-IR) to Alternaria alternata.},

abstract = {Cactus pear (Opuntia spp.) responds positively to supplemental organic and mineral nutrition. There are several recommended rates and sources of mineral nutrition for this crop. However, there is no information on ways to produce optimal fruit yield in cactus pear. The objective of this study was to test a nitrogen–phosphorus–potassium (NPK) fertilization matrix over three consecutive growing seasons and to determine its effect on yield and fruit quality of ‘Cristalina’ cactus pear. In the second and third growing seasons, mineral nutrition significantly increased fruit yield. Average yields were 9.6, 12.1, and 21.6tha−1 for the 2004, 2005, and 2006 growing seasons, respectively. Supplemental nutrition at a rate of 90N–30P–30K increased fruit yield 13.4- and 5.2-fold in the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons, respectively, over unfertilized control plants. Application of K alone had no effect on fruit yield. Therefore, the maximum biological response of fruit yield was estimated at 30.3tha−1 with 90kgha−1 N and 30kgha−1 P. Although fruit number increased, fruit size, as mean fruit weight, was similar among treatments. Fruit quality, determined as peel firmness, peel to pulp ratio, and total soluble solids concentration, exhibited inconsistent responses to supplemental mineral nutrition. Fruit dry matter was reduced as N and P application rates increased. Cladode macro- and micronutrients were found in sufficient concentrations, except for Mn. Even when Mn was at high concentrations, no toxic effects were observed in cactus pear plants. Spearman rank correlation between some fruit quality attributes and nutrient concentrations found a significant positive association between fruit firmness and cladode K concentration, but negatively association between TSSC and cladode N and K concentrations. Nutrient use efficiency decreased as N and P application rates increased. After plant and soil mineral analysis, the 90kgha−1 N and 30kgha−1 P could be applied to production sites by cactus pear growers. The lack of fruit yield response from cactus pear to K fertilization should be studied further because cactus pear extracts ∼54kgKyear−1. Over the long term, this constitutes an important drain on the ecosystem if no K is added back.},

abstract = {The efficacy of utilizing "controlled seed-tuber aging" as a technique to enhance yield and improve tuber quality in areas with relatively short growing seasons was investigated in a 3-yr study. Prior to planting in the field, five physiological ages of Russet Burbank, Carlton, Norchip and Superior seed-tubers were produced by varying the heat-unit accumulation over a 200-d storage interval. Total yield increases of up to 90\% and substantial improvements in tuber grade were achieved by planting aged (600-900 degree-day (dd)) seed-tubers. Plant growth from aged Russet Burbank seed-tubers was modelled to identify the mechanisms by which yield and quality were altered. Growth analysis demonstrated that the age-induced yield increases were due to faster emergence, faster leaf-area establishment, and tuberization earlier in the growing season compared with that from younger seed-tubers. The annual life cycle was thus accelerated, allowing plants from older seed-tubers to utilize the short (120-d) growing season more efficiently than those from younger seed-tubers. This was reflected in a higher harvest index: plants from 739 dd seed-tubers partitioned 63\% of their total fresh weight into tubers compared with 48\% for those from 66 dd seed-tubers (based on the quadratic model describing the relationship between seed-tuber age and harvest index at 121 d after planting). The technique appears to be very promising for enhancing yield and/or promoting 'earliness' of potatoes in regions with short growth seasons.},

abstract = {Jatropha curcas L. is a biodiesel crop that is resistant to drought stress. However, the salt tolerance of this plant has not yet been studied. To address this question, J. curcas seedlings were grown in a fertilised substrate to evaluate the effects of salinity stress on growth, leaf water relation and organic solutes, leaf and root mineral concentrations, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and carbohydrate concentration. The experiment consisted of six treatments with different concentrations of NaCl in the irrigation water: 0 (control), 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 mM. The total biomass exhibited a salt-induced decrease in the 60 mM or higher NaCl concentrations. The Cl - concentration was higher than the Na + concentration in all of the plant tissues. The water potential and relative water content of the leaves were not affected by any of the salt treatments. However, salinity induced a decline in the leaf K + concentration, together with a significant enhancement in the leaf P, S, Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu levels. The net assimilation of CO 2 also decreased with the salt treatment, due in part to non-stomatal limitation from the increase in C a/C i and a decrease in the maximum quantum efficiency (F v/F m) of photosystem II and soil plant analysis development (SPAD) units. This work suggests that J. curcas seedlings exhibit a moderate tolerance to salinity, as the plants were able to tolerate up to 4 dS m -1 (EC water irrigation; 30 mM NaCl). The negative influences of salinity in this crop are mainly due to Cl - and/or Na + toxicity and to a nutritional imbalance caused by an increase in the Na +/K + ratio. The osmotic effect of salinity in this species is negligible, perhaps due to its strong control of leaf transpiration, which reduces water loss. © 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {The drought stress tolerance of two Solanum tuberosum subsp. andigena landraces, one hybrid (adgxtbr) and Atlantic (S. tuberosum subsp. tuberosum) has been evaluated. Photosynthesis in the Andigena landraces during prolonged drought was maintained significantly longer than in the Tuberosum (Atlantic) line. Among the Andigena landraces, 'Sullu' (SUL) was more drought resistant than 'Negra Ojosa' (NOJ). Microarray analysis and metabolite data from leaf samples taken at the point of maximum stress suggested higher mitochondrial metabolic activity in SUL than in NOJ. A greater induction of chloroplast-localized antioxidant and chaperone genes in SUL compared with NOJ was evident. ABA-responsive TFs were more induced in NOJ compared with SUL, including WRKY1, mediating a response in SA signalling that may give rise to increased ROS. NOJ may be experiencing higher ROS levels than SUL. Metabolite profiles of NOJ were characterized by compounds indicative of stress, for example, proline, trehalose, and GABA, which accumulated to a higher degree than in SUL. The differences between the Andigena lines were not explained by protective roles of compatible solutes; hexoses and complex sugars were similar in both landraces. Instead, lower levels of ROS accumulation, greater mitochondrial activity and active chloroplast defences contributed to a lower stress load in SUL than in NOJ during drought.},

abstract = {KEY MESSAGE: QTL were identified for root architectural traits in maize. Root architectural traits, including the number, length, orientation, and branching of the principal root classes, influence plant function by determining the spatial and temporal domains of soil exploration. To characterize phenotypic patterns and their genetic control, three recombinant inbred populations of maize were grown for 28 days in solid media in a greenhouse and evaluated for 21 root architectural traits, including length, number, diameter, and branching of seminal, primary and nodal roots, dry weight of embryonic and nodal systems, and diameter of the nodal root system. Significant phenotypic variation was observed for all traits. Strong correlations were observed among traits in the same root class, particularly for the length of the main root axis and the length of lateral roots. In a principal component analysis, relationships among traits differed slightly for the three families, though vectors grouped together for traits within a given root class, indicating opportunities for more efficient phenotyping. Allometric analysis showed that trajectories of growth for specific traits differ in the three populations. In total, 15 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified. QTL are reported for length in multiple root classes, diameter and number of seminal roots, and dry weight of the embryonic and nodal root systems. Phenotypic variation explained by individual QTL ranged from 0.44 \% (number of seminal roots, NyH population) to 13.5 \% (shoot dry weight, OhW population). Identification of QTL for root architectural traits may be useful for developing genotypes that are better suited to specific soil environments.},

abstract = {Much effort has been expended to improve irrigation efficiency and drought tolerance of agronomic crops; however, a clear understanding of the physiological mechanisms that interact to decrease source strength and drive yield loss has not been attained. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms contributing to inhibition of net carbon assimilation under drought stress, three cultivars of Gossypium hirsutum were grown in the field under contrasting irrigation regimes during the 2012 and 2013 growing season near Camilla, Georgia, USA. Physiological measurements were conducted on three sample dates during each growing season (providing a broad range of plant water status) and included, predawn and midday leaf water potential ($\Psi$PD and $\Psi$MD), gross and net photosynthesis, dark respiration, photorespiration, and chlorophyll a fluorescence. End-of-season lint yield was also determined. $\Psi$PD ranged from -0.31 to -0.95MPa, and $\Psi$MD ranged from -1.02 to -2.67MPa, depending upon irrigation regime and sample date. G. hirsutum responded to water deficit by decreasing stomatal conductance, increasing photorespiration, and increasing the ratio of dark respiration to gross photosynthesis, thereby limiting PN and decreasing lint yield (lint yield declines observed during the 2012 growing season only). Conversely, even extreme water deficit, causing a 54\% decline in PN, did not negatively affect actual quantum yield, maximum quantum yield, or photosynthetic electron transport. It is concluded that PN is primarily limited in drought-stressed G. hirsutum by decreased stomatal conductance, along with increases in respiratory and photorespiratory carbon losses, not inhibition or down-regulation of electron transport through photosystem II. It is further concluded that $\Psi$PD is a reliable indicator of drought stress and the need for irrigation in field-grown cotton.},

abstract = {The relationship between imbibitional damage and the initial water content of soybean seeds was investigated. Imbibitional damage such as the lack of cotyledons was serious at water contents below 10\% but not over 20\%. The water content of 10\% was the point below which the signal of inorganic phosphate in cytoplasm disappeared in 31P-NMR spectra and the signals of sucrose in vacuoles disappeared below 20\% in 13C-NMR. Based on these results, it was concluded that the primary course of imbibitional damage was the mechanical destruction of cotyledons by the swelling of stored materials associated with rapid sorption of water into dry seeds.},

abstract = {Sugar metabolism was studied in sweet sorghum (SSV74) that is known to store sugars in the mature internodes and which is reported to give grain yields twice that of a grain sorghum variety (SPV1616). Comparison of sugar accumulation in these two varieties was carried out at three stages of growth and in the upper and lower internodes. In spite of large differences in the level of sugar accumulation, osmolarity of the sap did not vary as significantly in the two varieties. Significant contribution of variety, stage and internode position was seen for the variation observed in sugar content. Though the activities of sugar metabolizing enzymes namely sucrose synthase (in the synthesis and cleavage directions), sucrose phosphate synthase and invertase (cytoplasmic and vacuolar) also varied in a stage- and internode-specific manner in the two varieties, these enzymes did not contribute significantly to the variation observed in sugar content. Transcriptional expression of one sucrose synthase (SUC1), two sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS2 and SPS3) and a vacuolar invertase (INV3) gene were lower in sweet sorghum as compared to grain sorghum. Sweet sorghum also showed lower expression of two sucrose transporters (SUT1 and SUT4), which correlated to higher sugar accumulation in this variety. Differential expression of the sugar metabolizing enzymes and sucrose transporters in sweet and grain sorghum suggest a role for signaling molecules and transcription factors in regulating sugar accumulation observed in the mature internodes of sweet sorghum, which needs to be investigated.},

abstract = {To understand the physiological basis of genetic variation and resulting quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for photosynthesis in a rice (Oryza sativa L.) introgression line population, 13 lines were studied under drought and well-watered conditions, at flowering and grain filling. Simultaneous gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were conducted at various levels of incident irradiance and ambient CO(2) to estimate parameters of a model that dissects photosynthesis into stomatal conductance (g(s)), mesophyll conductance (g(m)), electron transport capacity (J(max)), and Rubisco carboxylation capacity (V(cmax)). Significant genetic variation in these parameters was found, although drought and leaf age accounted for larger proportions of the total variation. Genetic variation in light-saturated photosynthesis and transpiration efficiency (TE) were mainly associated with variation in g(s) and g(m). One previously mapped major QTL of photosynthesis was associated with variation in g(s) and g(m), but also in J(max) and V(cmax) at flowering. Thus, g(s) and g(m), which were demonstrated in the literature to be responsible for environmental variation in photosynthesis, were found also to be associated with genetic variation in photosynthesis. Furthermore, relationships between these parameters and leaf nitrogen or dry matter per unit area, which were previously found across environmental treatments, were shown to be valid for variation across genotypes. Finally, the extent to which photosynthesis rate and TE can be improved was evaluated. Virtual ideotypes were estimated to have 17.0\% higher photosynthesis and 25.1\% higher TE compared with the best genotype investigated. This analysis using introgression lines highlights possibilities of improving both photosynthesis and TE within the same genetic background.},

abstract = {The average yield of Australia\&\#8217;s major grain crop, wheat, rose at its fastest rate ever during the last decade. The environmental biology behind this advance was predominantly ecological and nutritional \&\#8212; endemic root diseases were controlled through better management of inoculum levels, and the consequently healthier crops were more responsive to fertiliser, especially nitrogen. Applying nitrogen fertilisers became less risky; farmers used much more and thereby achieved much higher yields. Despite Australia\&\#8217;s reputation for being drought prone, its crop yields have not hitherto been typically limited by water \&\#8212; poor health and poor nutrition have been more influential. Improvements in the management of health and nutrition have resulted in many crops now being limited by water, so the effectiveness with which that water is used in producing grain has become more important \&\#8212; capturing more of it, using it effectively in producing photosynthate, and ensuring that a large fraction of that photosynthate is converted into grain. Further improvement will come from the steady 1\% per year achieved by breeders, overlain by agronomic advances based on deeper ecophysiological understanding of the interaction between roots and soil biota, how roots access resources in the subsoil, and the basis of spatial variation in yield across a paddock.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are interlinked by primary production, respiration and decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems. It has been suggested that the C, N and P cycles could become uncoupled under rapid climate change because of the different degrees of control exerted on the supply of these elements by biological and geochemical processes. Climatic controls on biogeochemical cycles are particularly relevant in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid ecosystems (drylands) because their biological activity is mainly driven by water availability. The increase in aridity predicted for the twenty-first century in many drylands worldwide may therefore threaten the balance between these cycles, differentially affecting the availability of essential nutrients. Here we evaluate how aridity affects the balance between C, N and P in soils collected from 224 dryland sites from all continents except Antarctica. We find a negative effect of aridity on the concentration of soil organic C and total N, but a positive effect on the concentration of inorganic P. Aridity is negatively related to plant cover, which may favour the dominance of physical processes such as rock weathering, a major source of P to ecosystems, over biological processes that provide more C and N, such as litter decomposition. Our findings suggest that any predicted increase in aridity with climate change will probably reduce the concentrations of N and C in global drylands, but increase that of P. These changes would uncouple the C, N and P cycles in drylands and could negatively affect the provision of key services provided by these ecosystems.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to estimate and compare the daily actual evapotranspiration (ETc) for the maize crop, using Earth Observation data and the CROPWAT model, in the agrometeorological conditions of Romania. For the purpose of this paper, the CROPWAT model was run for the specific weather conditions of the year 2000, at two test-areas situated in the main agriculture production zone of Romania: Craiova and Alexandria. The method used in this study for the computation of ETc is based on the energy balance of the surface, expressed in a simplified from. The method uses the connection between the evapotranspiration, the net radiation and the difference between surface and air temperature, measured around 14:00h. local time of the satellite passage. The NOAA–AVHRR cloud-free satellite images on the Romanian territory were selected from the image database in the maize vegetation period (April–September 2000). Applying the method based on the energy balance of the surface, expressed by the two simplified versions, for the maize crop in the specific conditions of the Romanian Plain, the daily crop evapotranspiration values have been obtained. These values were compared with the outputs resulted from the CROPWAT model. The comparative analysis showed that the ETc values estimated by the method based on the energy balance of the surface which uses NOAA–AVHRR satellite-derived data, are generally greater than those simulated by the CROPWAT model, the differences being in the range +0.45 to −1.9mm/day. The results of the study showed that the ETc values estimated from both simplified versions of the method based on the energy balance of the surface are quite similar and in a good correlation with the simulated values obtained by the CROPWAT model, with relative errors of ±10–15\%. The results of the study emphasized that the satellite data could bring an important contribution for comparisons and validation of the model outputs for some parameters, like the crop daily evapotranspiration.},

abstract = {Drought tolerance is a complex trait of increasing importance in potato. Our knowledge is summarized concerning drought tolerance and water use efficiency in this crop. We describe the effects of water restriction on physiological characteristics, examine the main traits involved, report the attempts to improve drought tolerance through in vitro screening and marker assisted selection, list the main genes involved and analyze the potential interest of native and wild potatoes to improve drought tolerance. Drought tolerance has received more attention in cereals than in potato. The review compares these crops for indirect selection methods available for assessment of drought tolerance related traits, use of genetic resources, progress in genomics, application of water saving techniques and availability of models to anticipate the effects of climate change on yield. It is concluded that drought tolerance improvement in potato could greatly benefit from the transfer of research achievements in cereals. Several promising research directions are presented, such as the use of fluorescence, reflectance, color and thermal imaging and stable isotope techniques to assess drought tolerance related traits, the application of the partial root-zone drying technique to improve efficiency of water supply and the exploitation of stressful memory to enhance hardiness.},

abstract = {The genetic basis of cold-tolerance was investigated by analyzing the quantitative trait loci (QTL) of an F2:3 population derived from a cross between two lines bred for contrasting cold-tolerance using chlorophyll fluorescence as a selection tool. Chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, CO2 exchange rate, leaf greenness, shoot dry matter and shoot nitrogen content were determined in plants grown under controlled conditions at 25/22 degrees C or 15/13 degrees C (day/night). The analysis revealed the presence of 18 and 19 QTLs (LOD > 3.5) significantly involved in the variation of nine target traits in plants grown at 25/22 degrees C and 15/13 degrees C, respectively. Only four QTLs were clearly identified in both temperatures regimes for the same traits, demonstrating that the genetic control of the performance of the photosynthetic apparatus differed, depending on the temperature regime. A major QTL for the cold-tolerance of photosynthesis was identified on chromosome 6. This QTL alone explained 37.4 of the phenotypic variance in the chronic photoinhibition at low temperature and was significantly involved in the expression of six other traits, including the rate of carbon fixation and shoot dry matter accumulation, indicating that the tolerance to photoinhibition is a key factor in the tolerance of maize to low growth temperature. An additional QTL on chromosomes 2 corresponded to a QTL identified previously in another population, suggesting some common genetic basis of the cold-tolerance of photosynthesis in different maize germplasms.},

@article{Morecroft2003,
abstract = {The photosynthetic development of pedunculate oak ( Quercus robur L.) sun leaves in a mature woodland canopy in Oxfordshire, southern England, was investigated in situ during 3 years with contrasting weather conditions. Development of full photosynthetic capacity (indicated by light-saturated net assimilation rates, A(max), typical of the summer period) took between approximately 50 and 70 days after budbreak in different years. This slow development means that these leaves do not utilise a substantial fraction of the seasonal peak of solar irradiance. During the late autumn senscence period the photosynthetic capacity declined over a 2-week period, but as this is a time of low irradiance, the loss of potential photosynthesis was relatively small. The consequences of these developmental changes and differences in bud break dates for daily and seasonal leaf carbon balance were investigated through a simple light-response photosynthetic model. Seasonal changes in photosynthetic capacity would decrease annual carbon uptake per unit leaf area by about 23\% compared to that potentially possible if leaves photosynthesised at peak rates throughout the growing season. This difference is likely to be up to 30\% larger in years with late budburst and as low as 18\% in years with early budburst.},

abstract = {Stylosanthes, a genus of tropical forage legume, is known to exhibit good persistence in saline soils, yet mechanisms for regulation of seed germination under salt stress are poorly understood. This study was carried out to evaluate the mode of action of salt stress on seed germination of Stylosanthes. 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) increased ethylene biosynthesis and germination of NaCl-inhibited seeds in a dose-dependent manner. Contents of ACC and germination of Stylosanthes humilis seeds increased following transfer from NaCl solution to deionised water, but not after transfer to l-$\alpha$-(2-aminoethoxyvinyl)-glycine (AVG) solution, an inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis. Ethylene biosynthesis was much larger in NaCl-treated seeds of Stylosanthes guianensis than in seeds of S. humilis and Stylosanthes capitata, a fact which was reflected in higher germination rates. S. guianensis seedlings also displayed higher growth and survival rates than S. humilis and S. capitata under salt stress. Moreover, smaller ACC levels, as well as reduced ethylene biosynthesis of S. capitata seeds were accompanied by lower germination under salt stress. In addition, S. capitata seedlings treated with NaCl solutions exhibited relatively lower growth and survival rates in comparison with S. humilis and S. guianensis. Thus, different abilities to synthesize ethylene by S. guianensis, S. humilis and S. capitata seeds explain the differences in tolerance to salt stress of the three species.},

(MO) extracts and its curative role in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced toxic liver injury in rats caused by oxidative damage. The total phenolic content and antioxidant properties of hydroethanolic extracts of different MO edible parts were investigated by employing an established in vitro biological assay. In the antihepatotoxic study, either flowers or leaves extract (200 mg/kg or 400 mg/kg, i.p) were administered an hour after APAP administration, respectively. N-Acetylcysteine was used as the positive control against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. The levels of liver markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the levels of oxidative damage markers including malondialdehyde (MDA), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) protein adduct, reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were analysed and compared between experimental groups. Among MO edible parts the flower extracts contain the highest total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity, followed by leaves extract. The oxidative marker MDA, as well as 4-HNE protein adduct levels were elevated and GSH, SOD and CAT were significantly decreased in groups treated with hepatotoxin. The biochemical liver tissue oxidative markers measured in the rats treated with MO flowers and leaves hydroethanolic extracts showed a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in the severity of the liver damage. The results of this study strongly indicate the therapeutic properties of MO hydroethanolic extracts against acute liver injury and thereby scientifically support its traditional use.},

abstract = {A 4×4 complete diallel cross was set up with four different types of drought-resistant winter wheat varieties to define mutual relations among main quantitative traits and the contribution of each trait to the flag leaf transpiration efficiency (TE) in the grain filling phase. Through genetic correlative and path analysis, the influence of five physiological traits, net photosynthesis rate (Pn), stomatal conductance (Gs), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), transpiration rate (Tr), and leaf temperature (Tl), on flag leaf TE was observed. The results of variance analysis showed that there were very significant differences between TE and the related five traits, as well as between these five traits. The results of genetic correlation analysis showed also that the absolute values of the correlation coefficients of corresponding traits to TE should be ordered as Pn>Gs>Tl>Tr>Ci in the early grain filling stage, Ci>Tr>Pn>Gs>Tl in the middle grain filling stage, and Pn>Ci>Tl>Tr>Gs in the late grain filling stage, respectively. The results of the combined analysis of genetic correlation and path analysis showed that at the early filling stage, there existed a strong positive genetic correlation between Pn and TE, and at the same time Pn had a direct positive contribution to TE. With the progression of grain filling, the stress of high temperature and drought strengthened and the function of flag leaves weakened, so that at the late grain filling phase Ci, Tr and Tl were strongly negatively correlated with TE and all these traits conferred direct negative contributions to TE. The results of this research showed that the selection of wheat genetic materials with slow-ageing, high-photosynthesis, low-transpiration and low leaf temperature should assist breeding of wheat with more efficient use of water in north western China.},

@article{Hlavackova2006,
abstract = {Short-term (up to 1 h) systemic responses of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Samsun) plants to local burning of an upper leaf were studied by measuring the following variables in a distant leaf: extracellular electrical potentials (EEPs); gas exchange parameters; fast chlorophyll fluorescence induction; and endogenous concentrations of three putative chemical signaling compounds-abscisic (ABA), jasmonic (JA), and salicylic (SA) acids. The first detected response to local burning in the distant leaves was in EEP, which started to decline within 10-20 s of the beginning of the treatment, fell sharply for ca. 1-3 min, and then tended to recover within the following hour. The measured gasometric parameters (stomatal conductance and the rates of transpiration and CO(2) assimilation) started to decrease 5-7 min after local burning, suggesting that the electrical signals may induce stomatal closure. These changes were accompanied by systemic increases in the endogenous ABA concentration followed by huge systemic rises in endogenous JA levels started after ca. 15 min, providing the first evidence of short-term systemic accumulation of these plant hormones in responses to local burning. Furthermore, JA appears to have an inhibitory effect on CO(2) assimilation. The correlations between the kinetics of the systemic EEP, stomatal, photosynthetic, ABA, and JA responses suggest that (1) electrical signals (probably induced by a propagating hydraulic signal) may trigger chemical defense-related signaling pathways in tobacco plants; (2) both electrical and chemical signals are interactively involved in the induction of short-term systemic stomatal closure and subsequent reductions in the rate of transpiration and CO(2) assimilation after local burning events.},

abstract = {Two kinds of wheat genotypes with different tolerance to osmotic stress (NaCl and PEG-treatment) were investigated with biochemical analyses, including the measurements of total antioxidant capacity, 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity, reducing power and starch content. The results were compared with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data concerning the nature and amounts of stable long lived radicals present in the control and stressed plants. In addition, the changes in manganese content upon stress conditions were monitored. Different mechanisms of protection against PEG stress in sensitive and tolerant wheat genotypes were postulated. In sensitive genotypes, electrons were created in excess in stress conditions, and were stabilized by polysaccharide molecules, whereas in tolerant genotypes, protection by antioxidants dominated. Moreover, the quinone-semiquinone balance shifted towards semiquinone, which became the place of electron trapping. NaCl-treatment yielded significant effects mainly in sensitive genotypes and was connected with the changes of water structure, leading to inactivation of reactive oxygen species by water molecules.},

abstract = {Field experiment was carried out at Enshas Experiment Station; Jatropha was transplanted and treated after the second year of the transplanting by different amounts of water stress, viz. 125\%, 100\%, 75\% and 50\% of potential evapotranspiration (ETp). The study aims to ensure the multiple benefits of Jatropha and its suitability under Egypt's climate in unused lands under scarce water conditions. The results revealed that the average water consumption rate of Jatropha is 6Lweek−1 throughout the growing season, which means that Jatropha can survive and produce full yield with high quality seeds under minimum water requirements compared to other crops. The yield of extracted oil was 28.69, 58.39, 30.17 and 22.15kgha−1 at 125\%, 100\%, 75\% and 50\% of ETp, respectively. The lowest values of total lipid (oil) (25\% and 24.5\% of Jatropha seeds) were recorded with Jatropha trees that were irrigated by 125\% and 50\% of ETp, respectively. On the other hand, the treatment that was irrigated by 100\% of ETp (control) recorded the highest value of total oil in the seeds (29.93\%). The results also revealed that there are no significant differences among the values of the determined oil characteristics due to different water stress ratios. From the results, it could be concluded that the highest characteristics of Jatropha seed oil were recorded with 100\% of ETp. In addition water stress had no significant effect on the fatty acid composition of Jatropha seed oil.},

abstract = {Extensive work on plant–animal mutualistic networks has shown that species in such networks vary in their number of connections with other species, from highly connected species (‘super-generalists’) to those connected only to a few other species (‘specialists’). How these species with different degrees of network specialization differ in their speciation rate remains largely unexplored. Here we hypothesize that having many interaction partners lowers the amount of leverage of any one partner, and slows coevolution. We then explored the speciation rate in frugivorous birds in a dataset of published seed dispersal networks, using a recent phylogeny that has a date for the divergence time of all bird species from their most closely related sister taxa. We found that generalist species’ divergence time was longer than specialist species’. While there may be other correlated traits to specialization that could contribute to this result, specialists and generalists did not vary in the size of their global distributions, and thus specialists are not simply rarer, if the size of the distribution reflects the species’ abundance. We discuss whether similar tests can be applied to other kinds of plant–animal interactions, and what level of taxonomy is appropriate to investigate to answer these sorts of questions.},

abstract = {The effect of salinity on C(4) photosynthesis was examined in leaves of maize, a NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) type C(4) species. Potted plants with the fourth leaf blade fully developed were treated with 3\% NaCl solution for 5d. Under salt treatment, the activities of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) and NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH), which are derived mainly from mesophyll cells, increased, whereas those of NADP-ME and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, which are derived mainly from bundle sheath cells (BSCs), decreased. Immunocytochemical studies by electron microscopy revealed that PPDK protein increased, while the content of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase protein decreased under salinity. In salt-treated plants, the photosynthetic metabolites malate, pyruvate and starch decreased by 40, 89 and 81\%, respectively. Gas-exchange analysis revealed that the net photosynthetic rate, the transpiration rate, stomatal conductance (g(s)) and the intercellular CO(2) concentration decreased strongly in salt-treated plants. The carbon isotope ratio ($\delta$(13)C) in these plants was significantly lower than that in control. These findings suggest that the decrease in photosynthetic metabolites under salinity was induced by a reduction in gas-exchange. Moreover, in addition to the decrease in g(s), the decrease in enzyme activities in BSCs was responsible for the decline of C(4) photosynthesis. The increase of PPDK, PEPCase, NADP-MDH, and NAD-MDH activities and the decrease of NADP-ME activity are interpreted as adaptation responses to salinity.},

abstract = {Banana and its close relative, plantain are globally important crops and there is considerable interest in optimizing their cultivation. Plantain has superior cold tolerance compared with banana and a thorough understanding of the molecular mechanisms and responses of plantain to cold stress has great potential value for developing cold tolerant banana cultivars. In this study, we used iTRAQ-based comparative proteomic analysis to investigate the temporal responses of plantain to cold stress. Plantain seedlings were exposed for 0, 6, and 24 h of cold stress at 8 °C and subsequently allowed to recover for 24 h at 28 °C. A total of 3477 plantain proteins were identified, of which 809 showed differential expression from the three treatments. The majority of differentially expressed proteins were predicted to be involved in oxidation-reduction, including oxylipin biosynthesis, whereas others were associated with photosynthesis, photorespiration, and several primary metabolic processes, such as carbohydrate metabolic process and fatty acid beta-oxidation. Western blot analysis and enzyme activity assays were performed on seven differentially expressed, cold-response candidate plantain proteins to validate the proteomics data. Similar analyses of the seven candidate proteins were performed in cold-sensitive banana to examine possible functional conservation, and to compare the results to equivalent responses between the two species. Consistent results were achieved by Western blot and enzyme activity assays, demonstrating that the quantitative proteomics data collected in this study are reliable. Our results suggest that an increase of antioxidant capacity through adapted ROS scavenging capability, reduced production of ROS, and decreased lipid peroxidation contribute to molecular mechanisms for the increased cold tolerance in plantain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a global investigation on molecular responses of plantain to cold stress by proteomic analysis.},

abstract = {• Premise of the study: This study seeks to determine how hydraulic factors vary with ontogeny and whether they begin to limit further height growth in palms. Palms are an attractive group for physiological research because their columnar trunks and simple leaf habit allow key intrinsic and extrinsic hydraulic variables to be estimated more easily than in complex arborescent dicotyledons. • Methods: We measured various biometric and physiological factors including sap flux, leaf areas, turnover rates, and internode lengths in two Amazonian rainforest species: terra firme Iriartea deltoidea and swamp-adapted Mauritia flexuosa. These two palm species differ markedly in edaphic conditions, leaf type (pinnately compound vs. palmate), and bole development, making physiological comparisons between them important as well. • Key results: The species exhibited differing patterns in height growth rate along boles, which appear to relate to their differences in bole development. Growth rates ultimately slowed at the tops of tall palms in both species. We also found a high degree of convergence in total leaf area with height in both species even though they exhibited contrasting patterns in both live frond number and leaf area per frond with height. Sap flux density from leaves was constant with height but four times greater in M. flexuosa than in I. deltoidea. • Conclusions: Although height growth rates slow considerably in tall palms, neither species shows evidence that hydraulic factors become limiting because they are able to support much greater leaf areas with similar sap flux densities as shorter palms.},

Endogenous ABA, its metabolite phaseic acid (PA), and the expressions of VvNCED1 and VvCYP707A1 were highest in red light-emitting diode (LED)-treated skin. In contrast, anthocyanin concentrations were highest in blue LED-treated skin, followed by red LED treatment. However, the expressions of VlMYBA1-2, VlMYBA2, and VvUFGT did not necessarily coincide with anthocyanin concentrations. The quality of coloring may depend on the amount of malvidin-based anthocyanin, which increased toward harvest in blue and red LED-treated skin, unlike in untreated controls. An increase in sugars was also observed in blue and red LED-treated skin. These results suggest that blue LED irradiation at night may be effective in increasing anthocyanin and sugar concentrations in grape berries. However, there is evidence that another factor may influence anthocyanin concentrations in grape berry skin significantly more than endogenous ABA: ABA concentrations were highest in red LED-treated skin, which had lower anthocyanin concentrations than blue LED-treated skin.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Physiological and architectural plant models have originally been developed for different purposes and therefore have little in common, thus making combined applications difficult. There is, however, an increasing demand for crop models that simulate the genetic and resource-dependent variability of plant geometry and architecture, because man is increasingly able to transform plant production systems through combined genetic and environmental engineering.

MODEL: GREENLAB is presented, a mathematical plant model that simulates interactions between plant structure and function. Dual-scale automaton is used to simulate plant organogenesis from germination to maturity on the basis of organogenetic growth cycles that have constant thermal time. Plant fresh biomass production is computed from transpiration, assuming transpiration efficiency to be constant and atmospheric demand to be the driving force, under non-limiting water supply. The fresh biomass is then distributed among expanding organs according to their relative demand. Demand for organ growth is estimated from allometric relationships (e.g. leaf surface to weight ratios) and kinetics of potential growth rate for each organ type. These are obtained through parameter optimization against empirical, morphological data sets by running the model in inverted mode. Potential growth rates are then used as estimates of relative sink strength in the model. These and other 'hidden' plant parameters are calibrated using the non-linear, least-square method.

KEY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The model reproduced accurately the dynamics of plant growth, architecture and geometry of various annual and woody plants, enabling 3D visualization. It was also able to simulate the variability of leaf size on the plant and compensatory growth following pruning, as a result of internal competition for resources. The potential of the model's underlying concepts to predict the plant's phenotypic plasticity is discussed.},

abstract = {The present study investigated the effects of storage and aging on seed germination and seedling vigor in Jatropha curcas seeds, an oilseed plant with great potential for biodiesel production. Seeds were collected in 2009 and 2010 and stored under either room temperature or refrigerator conditions for 3, 6, 9 or 12months. Analyses of seed germination and vigor, seed reserves and several biochemical factors were conducted in the stored seeds. We show that Jatropha seeds have a short viability period (less than 6months) and that the increase of storage temperature accelerates the loss of seed germination potential. The loss of seed viability is due to metabolism of the seed itself, which remains active even under low levels of water and consumes the reserves of the seeds. Therefore, seeds stored for long periods demonstrated a marked decrease in their levels of starch and soluble proteins. Moreover, the presence of a high concentration of reducing sugars leads to the glycosylation of proteins and then lipid peroxidation, which increases the electrolyte leakage and subsequently causes extensive embryo damage or deterioration. These data are of great importance for decision making regarding the allocation of a particular seed lot, as they will directly influence the possibility of seed storage.},

abstract = {Soybean and potato plants were grown in controlled environments at carbon dioxide (CO2) partial pressures ranging from 0.05 to 1.00 kPa. The highest yields of edible biomass occurred at 0.10 kPa for both species, with higher CO2 levels being supraoptimal, but not injurious to the plants. Stomatal conductance rates of upper canopy leaves were lowest at 0.10 kPa CO2, while conductance rates at 0.50 and 1.00 kPa were significantly greater than 0.10 kPa. Total water use by the plants was greatest at the highest CO2 pressures (i.e. 0.50 and 1.00 kPa); consequently, water use efficiencies (biomass produced/water used) were low at the highest CO2 pressures. Based on previous CO2 studies in the literature, the increased conductance and water use at the highest CO2 pressures were surprising and pose interesting challenges for managing plants in a CELSS, where CO2 pressures may exceed optimal levels.},

abstract = {Water deficit is the major abiotic constraint affecting crop productivity in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.). Water use efficiency under drought conditions is thought to be one of the most promising traits to improve and stabilize crop yields under intermittent water deficit. A transcription factor DREB1A from Arabidopsis thaliana, driven by the stress inducible promoter from the rd29A gene, was introduced in a drought-sensitive peanut cultivar JL 24 through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. The stress inducible expression of DREB1A in these transgenic plants did not result in growth retardation or visible phenotypic alterations. T3 progeny of fourteen transgenic events were exposed to progressive soil drying in pot culture. The soil moisture threshold where their transpiration rate begins to decline relative to control well-watered (WW) plants and the number of days needed to deplete the soil water was used to rank the genotypes using the average linkage cluster analysis. Five diverse events were selected from the different clusters and further tested. All the selected transgenic events were able to maintain a transpiration rate equivalent to the WW control in soils dry enough to reduce transpiration rate in wild type JL 24. All transgenic events except one achieved higher transpiration efficiency (TE) under WW conditions and this appeared to be explained by a lower stomatal conductance. Under water limiting conditions, one of the selected transgenic events showed 40\% higher TE than the untransformed control.},

abstract = {The aim of this research was estimating the accuracy of CropWat software to calculating potential evapotranspiration (ET0) in arid and semi-arid region of Iran. For this purpose, 9 locations of arid and semi-arid regions of Iran selected and the grass lysimeter data collected too. The lysimeter data are collected duration of May through November during 1988-1997. For the comparisons of the ET0 lysimeter data and ET0 resulted CropWat software in different point, three statistical parameters were used include Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) and correlation coefficient (R2). The results of this research show that the average of MARE, RMSD and R2 computed about 31\%, 2.3 and 0.7, respectively in the study areas. In addition, the results of this research show that when the average of wind speed was less than 1 m sec(-1) or wind speed was more than 1 m sec(-1) with low ET0 lysimeter (ET0 less than 6 mm per day), CropWat has a low sensitive for estimating ET0 and it's necessary to improve the results for these areas. In concluded, the results of this research were showed that in these area because of intensive temperature and solar radiation, CropWat can not be estimated ET0 exactly.},

In FI, the whole root system was irrigated at 100\% of evapotranspiration (ETfull); in DI 50\% of ETfull was irrigated to the whole root system; in PRD 50\% of ETfull was irrigated to one soil column while the other was allowed to dry, and irrigation was shifted when 80–85\% of plant available water in the dry side had been used. Midday leaf water potential was similar for all treatments at 9 days after onset of treatments (DAT), while it was significantly lower in PRD than in FI and DI plants at 21 DAT. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration were generally greater in FI plants. Compared to FI, both DI and PRD significantly decreased leaf area and biomass. DI decreased biomass allocation to leaves and stems while increasing it into roots and tubers. PRD increased biomass allocation to roots. ET under PRD was ca. 80\% of DI and FI until six DAT, thereafter ET of DI and PRD was similar and was significantly less than that of FI. Water use of DI and PRD plants was 37\% less than that of FI. Water use efficiency (WUE) and transpiration efficiency were similar for PRD and FI plants, and were significantly less than those of DI plants. Conclusively, given the same amount (50\% of ETfull) of irrigation, PRD has no advantages compared to DI in terms of biomass production and WUE in potato at tuber initiation stage.},

The results indicated that acidic solutions were more effective than neutral and alkaline solutions in the elimination of the organochlorine compounds under investigation, Radish solutions eliminated pesticides completely, except o,p'-DDE (73.1\% loss), followed by citric and ascorbic acid solutions. On the other hand, organophosphorus pesticides (pirimphos methyl, malathion and profenofos) were eliminated more by acidic, neutral and alkaline solutions than by organochlorines. The percentage of removal ranged from 98.5 to 100\% for pirimphos methyl, 87.9 to 100\% for malathion and 100\% for profenofos.},

@article{Atkinson2012,
abstract = {Plant responses to different stresses are highly complex and involve changes at the transcriptome, cellular, and physiological levels. Recent evidence shows that plants respond to multiple stresses differently from how they do to individual stresses, activating a specific programme of gene expression relating to the exact environmental conditions encountered. Rather than being additive, the presence of an abiotic stress can have the effect of reducing or enhancing susceptibility to a biotic pest or pathogen, and vice versa. This interaction between biotic and abiotic stresses is orchestrated by hormone signalling pathways that may induce or antagonize one another, in particular that of abscisic acid. Specificity in multiple stress responses is further controlled by a range of molecular mechanisms that act together in a complex regulatory network. Transcription factors, kinase cascades, and reactive oxygen species are key components of this cross-talk, as are heat shock factors and small RNAs. This review aims to characterize the interaction between biotic and abiotic stress responses at a molecular level, focusing on regulatory mechanisms important to both pathways. Identifying master regulators that connect both biotic and abiotic stress response pathways is fundamental in providing opportunities for developing broad-spectrum stress-tolerant crop plants.},

Although cereals provide half of the calories consumed by humans, root and tuber crops are the second major source of carbohydrates globally. Yet, knowledge of root architecture in root and tuber species is limited. In this opinion article, we highlight what is known about the root system in root and tuber crops, and mark new research directions towards a better understanding of the relation between root architecture and yield. We believe that unraveling the role of root architecture in root and tuber crop productivity will improve global food security, especially in regions with marginal soil fertility and low-input agricultural systems.},

abstract = {(13)C discrimination in organic matter with respect to atmospheric CO(2) (Delta(13)C) is under tight genetic control in many plant species, including the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) full-sib progeny used in this study. Delta(13)C is expected to reflect intrinsic water use efficiency, but this assumption requires confirmation due to potential interferences with mesophyll conductance to CO(2), or post-photosynthetic discrimination. In order to dissect the observed Delta(13)C variability in this progeny, six genotypes that have previously been found to display extreme phenotypic values of Delta(13)C [either very high ('high Delta') or low ('low Delta') phenotype] were selected, and transpiration efficiency (TE; accumulated biomass/transpired water), net CO(2) assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance for water vapour (g(s)), and intrinsic water use efficiency (W(i)=A/g(s)) were compared with Delta(13)C in bulk leaf matter, wood, and cellulose in wood. As expected, 'high Delta' displayed higher values of Delta(13)C not only in bulk leaf matter, but also in wood and cellulose. This confirmed the stability of the genotypic differences in Delta(13)C recorded earlier. 'High Delta' also displayed lower TE, lower W(i), and higher g(s). A small difference was detected in photosynthetic capacity but none in mesophyll conductance to CO(2). 'High Delta' and 'low Delta' displayed very similar leaf anatomy, except for higher stomatal density in 'high Delta'. Finally, diurnal courses of leaf gas exchange revealed a higher g(s) in 'high Delta' in the morning than in the afternoon when the difference decreased. The gene ERECTA, involved in the control of water use efficiency, leaf differentiation, and stomatal density, displayed higher expression levels in 'low Delta'. In this progeny, the variability of Delta(13)C correlated closely with that of W(i) and TE. Genetic differences of Delta(13)C and W(i) can be ascribed to differences in stomatal conductance and stomatal density but not in photosynthetic capacity.},

abstract = {In etiolated leaves, saturating flash of 200 ms induces phototransformation of protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) F655 into chlorophyllide (Chlide), then into Chl through reactions which do not need light sensibilisation. The synthesis of Chl is known to be slowed down in etiolated leaves exposed to desiccation stress. In order to analyse the intensity and time-course of Chlide transformation into Chl, we used the fluorescence emission of etiolated leaves previously exposed to a 200 ms saturating flash. We used low-temperature fluorescence spectroscopy to reveal the inhibition site of Chl synthesis in etiolated barley leaves exposed to water stress. Shibata shift appears as the main target point of the water deficit. It was found that water deficit inhibits partially active Pchlide F655 regeneration. Also, esterification of Chlide into Chl is impaired. It appears that these inhibitory effects alter the appearance of PSII active reaction centres.},

abstract = {'Drought' has many meanings in relation to crop production. These range from: statistical (say, the lowest decile of annual rainfall) to a meteorologist; through yield being limited by too little water to an agronomist; to sudden severe water deficits to many molecular biologists. To a farmer, the corresponding management issues, respectively, are risk management (how best to manage a meteorologically drought-prone farm over several years), how best to match cultivar and agronomic operations to the developing growing season, and how best to minimize possible major damage to (say) floral fertility induced by severe water deficits during flowering. All these definitions and the issues they imply are relevant to improving crop production when water is limiting. How can scientists best help? The answers depend on the scales (temporal and spatial) being addressed. Agronomists and breeders, interacting, can help improve components of seasonal water balance in the field, for example, minimizing evaporative losses from the soil surface by better matching the development of a crop to its environment. Physiologists, biochemists, and molecular biologists can help by identifying ways of improving the competence of particular organs. A promising target is floral infertility resulting from water deficits, which results from lesions in tissue, and cellular and molecular processes. Choosing problems whose solutions will have implications in the field and be attractive to farmers requires knowledge of what is important in the field.},

abstract = {This study is conducted in the nursery of Department of Horticulture, College of Agricultural studies, Sudan University of Science and Technology, Sudan, to investigate sodium chloride ( NaCl) tolerance of Jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) transplants from seeds and stem cuttings . Also to determine which of them would be more suitable for utilization of salt affected soils. Two months old transplants from seeds and six months old transplants from stem cuttings were grown at three different NaCl concentrations (0.2, 0.4, and 0.8\% w/w of a clay soil with7.5 pH), in addition to a control without NaCl (0.0\%). The soil solution had 1.8 (control), 8, 12 and 16 dSm-1 E.c. Tap water was used for irrigation every other day. The experimental units were in completely randomized design with four replications. The main stem height and number of leaves were recorded at the beginning of the experiments and the transplants growth was evaluated after 30 and 60 days from planting. The results showed that the stem height of seed raised transplants was reduced significantly by increased NaCl concentration. The reduction was 46\% at 0.2\% NaCl (4dSm-1) compared to control, both after 30 and 60 days. However, there was no great reduction with further increase in NaCl concentration. The same was obtained for the number of leaves and fresh and dry weight. The stem cuttings transplants were less affected by increased NaCl concentration. It could be concluded that young Jatropha plants (older than two months) may be considered as NaCl tolerant. Stem cuttings transplants are highly tolerant than seed raised transplants and would be suitable for the utilization of NaCl affected soils.},

abstract = {Although Jatropha curcas, an important tropical biofuel crop, is reputed for its drought resistance, its ability to perform under dry conditions has hardly been investigated. In a greenhouse experiment we investigated the plant–water relationships of Jatropha seedlings from different accessions under different levels of drought stress. There was little difference in plant–water relations between accessions. Drought significantly reduced leaf area, biomass and relative growth rate, but had no effect on specific leaf area, daily range in leaf water potential, leaf water content, transpiration efficiency or aboveground biomass water productivity, corrected for atmospheric conditions. Stem wood density was equally low (0.26gcm−3) for all treatments. Stem water content was lowest for dry treatment seedlings. Based on these results, Jatropha could be characterized as a stem-succulent tree. In contrast to other stem-succulent deciduous trees, leaves were not shed immediately after the seedlings were confronted with drought. Instead, at the onset of drought, leaves with a higher adaxial stomatal density were formed, after which leaves were only gradually shed. The role of the succulent stem in the water economy of Jatropha was confined to balancing the small water losses of the leaves during drought.},

abstract = {Overexpression of genes that respond to drought stress is a seemingly attractive approach for improving drought resistance in crops. However, the consequences for both water-use efficiency and productivity must be considered if agronomic utility is sought. Here, we characterize two tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) lines (sp12 and sp5) that overexpress a gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes a key rate-limiting step in abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. Both lines contained more ABA than the wild type, with sp5 accumulating more than sp12. Both had higher transpiration efficiency because of their lower stomatal conductance, as demonstrated by increases in delta(13)C and delta(18)O, and also by gravimetric and gas-exchange methods. They also had greater root hydraulic conductivity. Under well-watered glasshouse conditions, mature sp5 plants were found to have a shoot biomass equal to the wild type despite their lower assimilation rate per unit leaf area. These plants also had longer petioles, larger leaf area, increased specific leaf area, and reduced leaf epinasty. When exposed to root-zone water deficits, line sp12 showed an increase in xylem ABA concentration and a reduction in stomatal conductance to the same final levels as the wild type, but from a different basal level. Indeed, the main difference between the high ABA plants and the wild type was their performance under well-watered conditions: the former conserved soil water by limiting maximum stomatal conductance per unit leaf area, but also, at least in the case of sp5, developed a canopy more suited to light interception, maximizing assimilation per plant, possibly due to improved turgor or suppression of epinasty.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT
Achenes of sunflower (cv Hi-Corn) were subjected for seven days to salinized solution culture containing 0, 50, 100 or 150 mol NaCl m−3. Fresh weights of cotyledons and hypocotyl increased at all external salt regimes, although the increase was low at the highest salt level. Na+, Cl− and Ca2+ concentrations in hypocotyls increased with time in all salt treatments. The external salt concentration or the time of incubation had no significant effect on Na+, K+ and Ca2+ concentration of cotyledons, but in contrast, there was a significant time course increase in Cl− level upon addition of salt to the rooting medium; this was not the case with the hypocotyl Cl− accumulation. A gradual decrease of soluble proteins with time was noted in cotyledons, but addition of salt was without any effect. By contrast, the hypocotyl soluble proteins decreased consistently with increasing salt level. There was no significant effect of NaCl on free amino acids level of cotyledons up to the 5th day of germination, but thereafter, cotyledonary free amino acids decreased considerably with increased salt level. There was a time-course decrease in soluble sugars of cotyledons and hypocotyl in control and at 50 mol NaCl m−3, but at higher NaCl concentrations soluble sugars in the hypocotyl increased with time. Total lipids of cotyledons decreased significantly with time. The salt effect on germination of sunflower was found to be associated with a time-course dependend absorption of Na+ and Cl− by the hypocotyl. In addition, the deleterious effect of salt on seed germination could be ascribed to impairment in breakdown of seed lipids thereby diminishing the supply of soluble sugars to the growing embryonic tissues.},

Zhonghuang-22) seeds for 72h at 25°C with polyethylene glycol (PEG8000) solution at -1.5MPa strongly improves chilling resistance. The aim of the present work was to investigate whether the beneficial effect of osmopriming is associated with restoration of the ascorbate-glutathione (ASC-GSH) cycle of mitochondria in soybean seeds. Compared with the control, both H(2)O(2) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in mitochondria of osmoprimed seeds decreased after chilling treatment, and these changes were associated with increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), glutathione reductase (GR), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and L-galactono-$\gamma$-lactone dehydrogenase (GLDH). However, the activity of dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) showed no obvious change during osmopriming treatment. Increased ASC and GSH contents accompanied prolonged osmopriming, and the reduced/oxidized ratios of ASC and GSH increased differently during osmopriming. These results indicate that osmopriming treatment enhances activity of the ASC-GSH cycle of mitochondria, which raises the chilling tolerance in soybean seeds and protects against H(2)O(2) that is generated in mitochondria during imbibition at low temperature.},

abstract = {Water-deficit stresses preferentially reduce shoot growth, thereby disrupting the flow of carbohydrates from source leaves to the developing sinks. Here, we use a novel stress bioassay to dissect responses of field and greenhouse-grown cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) source leaves to water-deficit stresses. Fifth main stem leaf samples were harvested at sunrise and subjected to a prolonged elevated respiratory demand in the dark. Sucrose levels are lower in nonstressed cotton at sunrise compared to water-deficit stressed cotton, potentially predisposing the nonstressed tissue to succumb more rapidly. Tissue death was determined initially using the cell viability stain 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, but was determined in subsequent experiments by monitoring the decline in chlorophyll fluorescence yield. Fluorescence yield measurements were obtained within minutes of harvesting and individual samples were monitored over the time course of the treatment. Analyses of the time course and magnitude of chlorophyll fluorescence yield decline in samples from irrigated and dryland plots permitted the detection of stress responses within 24 h of the cessation of irrigation. The rate of fluorescence yield decline during the elevated respiratory demand treatment slowed as the water-deficit stress increased. Upon irrigation, the source leaves of the water-stressed plants recovered to prestress values within 4 d. Well-watered cotton overexpressing heat shock protein 101 had identical rates of fluorescence yield decline as nontransgenic cotton. These results suggest that the delayed decline in fluorescence yield of water-stressed tissue exposed to prolonged elevated respiratory demand can be used as a sensitive indicator of water-deficit stress responses.},

abstract = {The African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is the most effective oil producer in tons per hectare. Nevertheless, its increasing cultivation in Latin America is harmed by the "lethal yellowing". Genetic resistance to this anomaly can be found in the germplasm of American oil palm or caiau\'{e} (E. oleifera), a native species from the Amazon rainforest. However, the procedures adopted to induce seeds of E. guineensis to germination frequently result mild for interespecific hybrids. Embryo in vitro cultivation can be a viable option. This work was aimed initially to test liquid MS medium supplemented with different glucose or sucrose concentrations for the in vitro cultivation of zygotic embryos from E. guineensis x E. oleifera controlled pollinations. Additionally we investigated different compost mixtures to acclimatize the regenerated hybrid plantlets. Concentrations of 10, 20 and 30g/L of both sugars were tested on flasks containing five mature zygotic embryos, with 15 repetitions per treatment in a total of 450 explants. The number of embryos displaying shoots and radicles at least 2mm in length per experimental unit was evaluated during phase one of in vitro cultivation. Plantlets displaying shoots and radicles were transferred to phase two of in vitro cultivation and subsequently to acclimatization, under 70\% shading with manual water supply. The experiments of acclimatization were conducted with 130 plantlets randomly distributed in pure horticultural compost, 3:1 or 1:1 compost:sand mixtures and each plantlet was defined as an experimental unit. Data were submitted to ANOVA, t test and analyzes of correlation (p < or = 0.05). Highest emergence rates were 97\% for shoots and 73\% for radicles, observed in MS medium supplemented with 20g/L (110mM) of glucose. This sugar in concentrations of 20 or 30g/L provided balanced shoot/root development, and this was considered one of the reasons for the higher frequency of plantlet establishment. The survival percentage was 55\% after the first 43 days of acclimatization and by the fourth month, 66 plants developed simultaneously longer shoot and root systems in pure horticultural compost. In conclusion, radicle development was an impairment to plantlet establishment and was overcame under media with glucose above 110mM. Acclimatization could benefit from an extended period of in vitro development.},

@article{Yang2005,
abstract = {Stomata function as the gates between the plant and the atmospheric environment. Stomatal movement, including stomatal opening and closing, controls CO2 absorption as the raw material for photosynthesis and water loss through transpiration. How to reduce water loss and maintain enough CO2 absorption has been an interesting research topic for some time. Simple stomatal opening may elevate CO2 absorption, but, in the meantime, promote the water loss, whereas simple closing of stomatal pores may reduce both water loss and CO2 absorption, resulting in impairment of plant photosynthesis. Both processes are not economical to the plant. As a special rhythmic stomatal movement that usually occurs at smaller stomatal apertures, stomatal oscillation can keep CO2 absorption at a sufficient level and reduce water loss at the same time, suggesting a potential improvement in water use efficiency. Stomatal oscillation is usually found after a sudden change in one environmental factor in relatively constant environments. Many environmental stimuli can induce stomatal oscillation. It appears that, at the physiological level, feedback controls are involved in stomatal oscillation. At the cellular level, possibly two different patterns exist: (i) a quicker responsive pattern; and (ii) a slower response. Both involve water potential changes and water channel regulation, but the mechanisms of regulation of the two patterns are different. Some evidence suggests that the regulation of water channels may play a vital and primary role in stomatal oscillation. The present review summarizes studies on stomatal oscillation and concludes with some discussion regarding the mechanisms of regulation of stomatal oscillation.},

abstract = {Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) were grown in the laboratory and leaves were taken from field-grown birch trees (Betula pendula Roth). Chlorophyll fluorescence, CO2 uptake and O2 evolution were measured and electron transport rates were calculated, J(C) from the CO2 uptake rate considering ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) carboxylation and oxygenation, J(O) from the O2 evolution rate, and J(F) from Chl fluorescence parameters. Mesophyll diffusion resistance, r(md), used for the calculation of J(C), was determined such that the in vivo Rubisco kinetic curve with respect to the carboxylation site CO2 concentration became a rectangular hyperbola with Km(CO2) of 10 microM at 22.5 degrees C. In sunflower, in the absence of external O2, J(O) = 1.07 J(C) when absorbed photon flux density (PAD) was varied, showing that the O2-independent components of the alternative electron flow to acceptors other than CO2 made up 7\% of J(C). Under saturating light, J(F), however, was 20-30\% faster than J(C), and J(F)-J(C) depended little on CO2 and O2 concentrations. The inter-relationship between J(F)-J(C) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) was variable, dependent on the CO2 concentration. We conclude that the relatively fast electron flow J(F)-J(C) appearing at light saturation of photosynthesis contains a minor component coupled with proton translocation, serving for nitrite, oxaloacetate and oxygen reduction, and a major component that is mostly cyclic electron transport around PSII. The rate of the PSII cycle is sufficient to release the excess excitation pressure on PSII significantly. Although the O2-dependent Mehler-type alternative electron flow appeared to be under the detection threshold, its importance is discussed considering the documented enhancement of photosynthesis by oxygen.},

Four combinations of treatments were conducted: well-watered plants with and without Se foliar spraying, and drought exposed plants with and without Se foliar spraying. The following parameters were monitored 2 and 4 weeks after treatments: net photosynthesis, transpiration rate, quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII), and respiratory potential measured by electron transport system activity. After 3 months of treatments, leaf water potential and tuber yield were determined. The content of Se in tubers was measured after harvesting time. Several effects of drought and Se foliar spraying and their combinations were found. Net photosynthesis and respiratory potential were lower in drought exposed plants 4 weeks after treatments. Se induced higher respiratory potential in the leaves 4 weeks after treatments. Higher efficiency of energy conversion in PSII, expressed by a higher effective quantum yield, was observed in Se treated plants 2 weeks after treatments. Foliarly applied Se was efficiently absorbed by plant leaves and transported to the tubers.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological responses of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) plants exposed to water stress and salinity in order to elucidate some acclimatory mechanisms. Mild water and salt stresses were imposed by plant exposure to -0.22MPa iso-osmotic solutions with PEG 6000 or NaCl 50mM for 8 days. Stress recovery was evaluated under control conditions after three and eight days. PEG treatment caused higher reductions in $\Psi$w and $\Psi$s, but both relative water content and succulence were not affected by the two stress treatments, compared to the control. The PEG-stressed plants suffered higher restrictions in leaf growth compared to the salt-stressed ones. Moreover, only the PEG treatment caused a pronounced effect on leaf membrane integrity. Both treatments caused similar impairment of the CO2 assimilation rate, but the PEG stressed plants showed higher restriction in stomatal conductance and transpiration. Although both stresses caused significant decreases on the leaf chlorophyll content, the photochemical activity was not affected. Since the plants subjected to mild water and salt stresses showed a rapid and almost complete recovery, these physiological alterations could represent a set of adaptive mechanisms employed by J. curcas to cope with these stressful conditions.},

abstract = {Needles from phosphorus deficient seedlings of Pinus radiata D. Don grown for 8 weeks at either 330 or 660 microliters CO(2) per liter displayed chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics characteristic of structural changes within the thylakoid chloroplast membrane, i.e. constant yield fluorescence (F(O)) was increased and induced fluorescence ([F(P)-F(I)]/F(O)) was reduced. The effect was greatest in the undroughted plants grown at 660 mul CO(2) L(-1). By week 22 at 330 mul CO(2) L(-1) acclimation to P deficiency had occurred as shown by the similarity in the fluorescence characteristics and maximum rates of photosynthesis of the needles from the two P treatments. However, acclimation did not occur in the plants grown at 660 mul CO(2) L(-1). The light saturated rate of photosynthesis of needles with adequate P was higher at 660 mul CO(2) L(-1) than at 330 mul CO(2) L(-1), whereas photosynthesis of P deficient plants showed no increase when grown at the higher CO(2) concentration. The average growth increase due to CO(2) enrichment was 14\% in P deficient plants and 32\% when P was adequate. In drought stressed plants grown at 330 mul CO(2) L(-1), there was a reduction in the maximal rate of quenching of fluorescence (R(Q)) after the major peak. Constant yield fluorescence was unaffected but induced fluorescence was lower. These results indicate that electron flow subsequent to photosystem II was affected by drought stress. At 660 mul CO(2) L(-1) this response was eliminated showing that CO(2) enrichment improved the ability of the seedlings to acclimate to drought stress. The average growth increase with CO(2) enrichment was 37\% in drought stressed plants and 19\% in unstressed plants.},

abstract = {In order to study the effects of desiccation on a photosynthetic system, light harvesting and light-induced electron transport processes were examined in pea cotyledons at various moisture levels, using in vivo fluorescence excitation spectra and fluorescence induction kinetics. Water sorption isotherms yielded thermodynamic data that suggested very strong water binding between 4 to 11\% water, intermediate sorption between water contents of 13 to 22\%, and very weak binding at moisture contents between 24 to 32\%. The fluorescence properties of the tissue changed with the moisture contents, and these changes correlated generally with the three regions of water binding. Peak fluorescence and fluorescence yield remained at low levels when water content was limited to the tightly bound regions, below 12\%. Several new peaks appeared in the chlorophyll a excitation spectrum and both peak fluorescence and fluorescence yield increased at intermediate water-binding levels (12-22\%). At moisture contents where water is weakly bound (>24\%), peak fluorescence and fluorescence yield were maximum and the fluorescence excitation spectrum was unchanging with further increases in water content.The state of water is an important component in the energy transfer and electron transport system. At hydration levels where water is most tightly bound, energy transfer from pigments is limited and electron transport is blocked. At intermediate water binding levels, energy transfer and electron transport increase and, in the region of weak water binding, energy transfer and electron transport are maximized.},

abstract = {The effect of dark-chilling and subsequent photoactivation on chloroplast structure and arrangements of chlorophyll-protein complexes in thylakoid membranes was studied in chilling-tolerant (CT) pea and in chilling-sensitive (CS) tomato. Dark-chilling did not influence chlorophyll content and Chl a/b ratio in thylakoids of both species. A decline of Chl a fluorescence intensity and an increase of the ratio of fluorescence intensities of PSI and PSII at 120 K was observed after dark-chilling in thylakoids isolated from tomato, but not from pea leaves. Chilling of pea leaves induced an increase of the relative contribution of LHCII and PSII fluorescence. A substantial decrease of the LHCII/PSII fluorescence accompanied by an increase of that from LHCI/PSI was observed in thylakoids from chilled tomato leaves; both were attenuated by photoactivation. Chlorophyll fluorescence of bright grana discs in chloroplasts from dark-chilled leaves, detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy, was more condensed in pea but significantly dispersed in tomato, compared with control samples. The chloroplast images from transmission-electron microscopy revealed that dark-chilling induced an increase of the degree of grana stacking only in pea chloroplasts. Analyses of O-J-D-I-P fluorescence induction curves in leaves of CS tomato before and after recovery from chilling indicate changes in electron transport rates at acceptor- and donor side of PS II and an increase in antenna size. In CT pea leaves these effects were absent, except for a small but irreversible effect on PSII activity and antenna size. Thus, the differences in chloroplast structure between CS and CT plants, induced by dark-chilling are a consequence of different thylakoid supercomplexes rearrangements.},

abstract = {Globally, agriculture accounts for 80-90\% of all freshwater used by humans, and most of that is in crop production. In many areas, this water use is unsustainable; water supplies are also under pressure from other users and are being affected by climate change. Much effort is being made to reduce water use by crops and produce 'more crop per drop'. This paper examines water use by crops, taking particularly a physiological viewpoint, examining the underlying relationships between carbon uptake, growth and water loss. Key examples of recent progress in both assessing and improving crop water productivity are described. It is clear that improvements in both agronomic and physiological understanding have led to recent increases in water productivity in some crops. We believe that there is substantial potential for further improvements owing to the progress in understanding the physiological responses of plants to water supply, and there is considerable promise within the latest molecular genetic approaches, if linked to the appropriate environmental physiology. We conclude that the interactions between plant and environment require a team approach looking across the disciplines from genes to plants to crops in their particular environments to deliver improved water productivity and contribute to sustainability.},

@article{Krackhardt1995,
abstract = {Time course accumulations of organic acids and proline were measured in soybean (Glycine max Merr, cv. Maple Arow) seeds. Seeds were soaked and germinated either in control Knop solution (C solution), in buffered C (from pH 4 to pH 7.8), or in C supplemented with -0.11 MPa isoosmotic salts (KC1, NaCl, NH4C1, CaCl2, mannitol). Solute analyses were carried out during imbibition (from 0 to 12 h) or 5 days after radicle emergence. Soaking seeds as well as seedlings (at the stage of radicle emergence) were transferred from C into NaCl or mannitol media, or from NaCl into C solution. During imbibition, KC1, NaCl and mannitol caused a 50 \% increase of the organic acid pool (mainly succinate), while proline increased only slightly. Conversely, pH solutions did not exert changes in organic acids, proline levels decreasing only at a pH value about 8. NaCl-treated seeds previously soaked for 1 h in C solution displayed increased organic acid contents compared with seeds continuously soaked in C solution. Yet, no change in organic acids was detectable in seeds soaked in NaCl solution or transferred into C after 1 or 6 h of exposure to NaCl. In NaCl-imbibed seeds, the proline synthesis began after a 7-h lag phase and was independent from external osmolarity. Growth of NaCl-treated seedlings decreased by 55 \% compared with C seedlings. Dry matter production, organic acid and proline levels remained comparable either in seedlings stressed by 1-h imbibition in NaCl before transfer into control solution, or in salt tolerant seedlings imbibed in control medium before transfer into NaCl medium. The relationships between proline and organic acid accumulation, NaCl-sensitivity of seeds and NaCl-tolerance of seedclings are discussed.},

abstract = {Analysis of the transcriptome of the kleptoplastic sea slug, Elysia chlorotica, has revealed the presence of at least 101 chloroplast-encoded gene sequences and 111 transcripts matching 52 nuclear-encoded genes from the chloroplast donor, Vaucheria litorea. These data clearly show that the symbiotic chloroplasts are translationally active and, of even more interest, that a variety of functional algal genes have been transferred into the slug genome, as has been suggested by earlier indirect experiments. Both the chloroplast- and nuclear-encoded sequences were rare within the E. chlorotica transcriptome, suggesting that their copy numbers and synthesis rates are low, and required both a large amount of sequence data and native algal sequences to find. These results show that the symbiotic chloroplasts residing inside the host molluscan cell are maintained by an interaction of both organellar and host biochemistry directed by the presence of transferred genes.},

abstract = {Two potato clones (Solanum tuberosum L.) of the Andean cultivar group, called Sullu and SS2613, with different drought-tolerance phenotypes were exposed to a continuously increasing drought stress in a field trial. At the physiological level, while relative leaf water contents were similar in both clones, osmotic potential was lower in Sullu and declined more strongly during drought compared with SS2613. In the drought-stressed plants, tuber yield was reduced by about 70\% compared with control plants in both clones. Potato cDNA microarrays and target metabolite analysis were performed on leaves sampled at several time-points after the onset of drought. At the transcriptomic level, photosynthesis-related genes were already strongly repressed in Sullu after 28 d of withholding irrigation and even more strongly after a longer stress duration, whereas, in SS2613, repression occurred only after 49 d of soil drying; similarly, a strong perturbation of carbohydrate-related genes was observed in Sullu. At the metabolite level, differential accumulation of osmotically active solutes was observed between the two cultivars; indeed, in Sullu, contents of galactose, inositol, galactinol, proline, and proline analogues were higher upon drought stress compared with SS2613. These results point to different drought responses in the cultivars at the leaf level, with, however, similar tuber yield reductions. The previously shown tolerant clone Sullu lost part of its tolerance under the experimental conditions used here; it was, however, able to maintain an absolute yield three times higher than SS2613.},

abstract = {Two serologically unrelated sweet potato viruses causing symptoms of vein clearing in the indicator plant Ipomoea setosa were isolated and their genomes have been sequenced. They are associated with symptomless infections in sweet potato but distinct vein-clearing symptoms and higher virus titres were observed when these viruses co-infected with sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), a virus that is distributed worldwide and is a mediator of severe virus diseases in this crop. Molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis revealed an overall nucleotide identity of 47.6 \% and an arrangement of the movement protein and coat protein domains characteristic of members of the genus Cavemovirus, in the family Caulimoviridae. We detected both cavemoviruses in cultivated sweet potato from East Africa, Central America and the Caribbean islands, but not in samples from South America. One of the viruses characterized showed a similar genome organization as, and formed a phylogenetic sublineage with, tobacco vein clearing virus (TVCV), giving further support to the previously suggested separation of TVCV, and related viral sequences, into a new caulimovirid genus. Given their geographical distribution and previous reports of similar but yet unidentified viruses, sweet potato cavemoviruses may co-occur with SPCSV more often than previously thought and they could therefore contribute to the extensive yield losses and cultivar decline caused by mixed viral infections in sweet potato.},

abstract = {Genetic resistance is a valuable tool in the fight against late blight of potatoes but little is known about the stability and specificity of quantitative resistance including the effect of defeated major resistance genes. In the present study we investigated the effect of different isolates of Phytophthora infestans on the mode of action of R(Pi-ber), an R-gene originating from Solanum berthaultii. The experiments were conducted on progenies derived from two reciprocal inter-specific backcrosses of Solanum tuberosum and S. berthaultii. The plant-pathogen interaction was tested in diverse environments including field, greenhouse and growth chamber conditions. The R(Pi-ber) gene provided complete resistance against a US8 isolate of P. infestans in all trials. When isolates compatible with R(Pi-ber) were used for inoculation, a smaller, but significant resistance effect was consistently detected in the same map position as the R-gene. This indicates that this R-gene provides a residual resistance effect, and/or that additional resistance loci are located in this genomic region of chromosome X. Additional quantitative resistance loci (QRL) were identified in the analyzed progenies. While some of the QRL (such as those near TG130 on chromosome III) were effective against several isolates of the pathogen, others were isolate specific. With a single exception, the S. berthaultii alleles were associated with a decrease in disease severity. Resistance loci reported in the present study co-locate with previously reported R-genes and QRL to P. infestans and other pathogens.},

abstract = {Abstract Maize production in Benin, especially in resource-poor farmers' fields, is constrained by stemborers among other factors. One of the major stemborers in southern Benin is Sesamia calamistis Hampson (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). African farmers cannot afford to use commercial insecticides for controlling stemborers - they are expensive and unsuitable for durable pest management systems due to eco-toxicity. There is therefore a need for cheaper and environmentally friendly methods and botanicals offer an attractive alternative. The bushmint, Hyptis suaveolens (L.) Poit. (Lamiales: Lamiaceae), was compared with the commercial insecticide Furadan (carbofuran) for the control of S. calamistis on maize Zea mays L. (Poales: Poaceae). Trials were conducted in the screenhouse and in the field during the minor cropping season in 2004 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA)-Benin station. The variables measured included numbers of egg masses per plant, eggs per egg mass (in the screenhouse study), population density of S. calamistis, percentage of infested plants and/or ears, and deadhearts in the field. Irrespective of the variable considered, the aqueous extract of H. suaveolens compared favorably with Furadan while maize surrounded by live H. suaveolens plants had lower S. calamistis densities.},

abstract = {Main and interaction effects of day-length and pathogen isolate on the reaction and expression of field resistance to Phytophthora infestans were analyzed in a sample of standard clones for partial resistance to potato late blight, and in the BCT mapping population derived from a backcross of Solanum berthaultii to Solanum tuberosum. Detached leaves from plants grown in field plots exposed to short- and long day-length conditions were independently inoculated with two P. infestans isolates and incubated in chambers under short- and long photoperiods, respectively. Lesion growth rate (LGR) was used for resistance assessment. Analysis of variance revealed a significant contribution of genotype x isolate x day-length interaction to variation in LGR indicating that field resistance of genotypes to foliar late blight under a given day-length depended on the infecting isolate. An allele segregating from S. berthaultii with opposite effects on foliar resistance to late blight under long- and short day-lengths, respectively, was identified at a quantitative trait locus (QTL) that mapped on chromosome 1. This allele was associated with positive (decreased resistance) and negative (increased resistance) additive effects on LGR, under short- and long day-length conditions, respectively. Disease progress on whole plants inoculated with the same isolate under field conditions validated the direction of its effect in short day-length regimes. The present study suggests the occurrence of an isolate-specific QTL that displays interaction with isolate behavior under contrasting environments, such as those with different day-lengths. This study highlights the importance of exposing genotypes to a highly variable population of the pathogen under contrasting environments when stability to late blight resistance is to be assessed or marker-assisted selection is attempted for the manipulation of quantitative resistance to late blight.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maca is an Andean crop of the Brassicaceae family which is mainly known for its fertility-enhancing properties following consumption. The hypocotyls display various colours ranging from white to black. Each colour has different biological effects. The aim of this study was to analyse the concentrations of major secondary metabolites in hypocotyls and leaves of maca in a controlled planting experiment in the Peruvian Andes at 4130 m above sea level. The effects of colour type and of previous cultivation of the field were examined. RESULTS: In the hypocotyls, the colour type effect was significant for most secondary metabolites; exceptions were beta-sitosterol and campesterol. The lead-coloured, yellow and violet maca hypocotyls were rich in glucosinolates, macaene and macamides, respectively. Previous cultivation affected macaene, campesterol and indole glucosinolate concentrations. Effects on metabolite concentrations in the leaves were minor. Hypocotyls were richer in macaene, macamides and glucosinolates than were leaves, and were poorer in beta-sitosterol and total phenols. CONCLUSION: Colour type has to be considered in maca production, as colour associates with variations in concentrations of distinct bioactive metabolites. Leaves may be interesting for animal nutrition purposes as they contain essentially the same secondary metabolites as the hypocotyls but in clearly lower concentrations.},

abstract = {Solanum section Petota is taxonomically difficult, partly because of interspecific hybridization at both the diploid and polyploid levels. The taxonomy of cultivated potatoes is particularly controversial. Using DNA sequence data of the waxy gene, we here infer relationships among the four species of cultivated potatoes accepted in the latest taxonomic treatment (S. ajanhuiri, S. curtilobum, S. juzepczukii and S. tuberosum, the latter divided into the Andigenum and Chilotanum Cultivar Groups). The data support prior ideas of hybrid origins of S. ajanhuiri from the S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (2x = S. stenotomum) × S. megistacrolobum; S. juzepczukii from the S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (2x = S. stenotomum) × S. acaule; and S. curtilobum from the S. tuberosum Andigenum Group (4x = S. tuberosum subsp. andigenum) × S. juzepczukii. For the tetraploid cultivar-groups of S. tuberosum, hybrid origins are suggested entirely within much more closely related species, except for two of three examined accessions of the S. tuberosum Chilotanum Group that appear to have hybridized with the wild species S. maglia. Hybrid origins of the crop/weed species S. sucrense are more difficult to support and S. vernei is not supported as a wild species progenitor of the S. tuberosum Andigenum Group.},

Herein we present evidence that shows that the application of multifractal analysis and wavelet transform to spectroradiometrical data improves the diagnostic power of the remote sensing-based methodology proposed in our previous work. The diagnosis of viral infection was effectively enhanced, providing the earliest detection ever reported, as anomalies were detected 29 and 33 days before appearance of visual symptoms in two experiments.},

abstract = {Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV, genus Potyvirus) is globally the most common pathogen of cultivated sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas; Convolvulaceae). Although more than 150 SPFMV isolates have been sequence-characterized from cultivated sweet potatos across the world, little is known about SPFMV isolates from wild hosts and the evolutionary forces shaping SPFMV population structures. In this study, 46 SPFMV isolates from 14 wild species of genera Ipomoea, Hewittia and Lepistemon (barcoded for the matK gene in this study) and 13 isolates from cultivated sweet potatoes were partially sequenced. Wild plants were infected with the EA, C or O strain, or co-infected with the EA and C strains of SPFMV. In East Africa, SPFMV populations in wild species and sweet potato were genetically undifferentiated, suggesting inter-host transmission of SPFMV. Globally, spatial diversification of the 178 isolates analysed was observed, strain EA being largely geographically restricted to East Africa. Recombination was frequently detected in the 6K2-VPg-NIaPro region of the EA strain, demonstrating a recombination 'hotspot'. Recombination between strains EA and C was rare, despite their frequent co-infections in wild plants, suggesting purifying selection against strain EA/C recombinants. Positive selection was predicted on 17 amino acids distributed over the entire coat protein in the globally distributed strain C, as compared to only four amino acids in the coat protein N-terminus of the EA strain. This selection implies a more recent introduction of the C strain and a higher adaptation of the EA strain to the local ecosystem. Thus, East Africa appears as a hotspot for evolution and diversification of SPFMV.},

These results explain previous failed attempts to characterize SPCV based on antibodies or primers designed for other members of the Caulimoviridae. Using a quick DNA extraction protocol and PCR primers flanking the RT motif region, we were able to detect SPCV directly in sweet potato, thus saving considerable time during routine virus indexing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sex pheromones of the potato tuber moths Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller) and Symmetrischema tangolias (Gyen) are ideal tools to monitor pest flight activity but are not used as means of control. The aim of the present study was to test the suitability of an attract-and-kill strategy consisting of pure pheromones and the contact insecticide cyfluthrin as the active ingredient, formulated with plant oils and ultraviolet absorbers, and applied in droplet sizes of 100 microL. RESULTS: Cyfluthrin at a concentration of 5 g L(-1) resulted in the highest and fastest killing of males after 48 h, with a 100\% mortality after 3-4 days. In contrast, control males survived for 13 days. In olfactometer experiments, the pheromone concentration of 0.5 g L(-1) was significantly most attractive against eight virgin females. At controlled conditions (20 degrees C), no reduction in efficacy of the attract-and-kill formulation was observed for a minimum period of 36 days, whereas under natural environmental conditions the efficacy reduced gradually after day 6 of exposure. The longer the droplet was exposed, the longer was the time to reach 100\% mortality of males. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with attract-and-kill studies for other pest species, the results are promising as a means of achieving highly effective control of potato tuber moths under field conditions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.), a hexaploid outcrossing crop, is an important staple and food security crop in developing countries in Africa and Asia. The availability of genomic resources for sweetpotato is in striking contrast to its importance for human nutrition. Previously existing sequence data were restricted to around 22,000 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences and \~{} 1,500 GenBank sequences. We have used 454 pyrosequencing to augment the available gene sequence information to enhance functional genomics and marker design for this plant species. RESULTS: Two quarter 454 pyrosequencing runs used two normalized cDNA collections from stems and leaves from drought-stressed sweetpotato clone Tanzania and yielded 524,209 reads, which were assembled together with 22,094 publically available expressed sequence tags into 31,685 sets of overlapping DNA segments and 34,733 unassembled sequences. Blastx comparisons with the UniRef100 database allowed annotation of 23,957 contigs and 15,342 singletons resulting in 24,657 putatively unique genes. Further, 27,119 sequences had no match to protein sequences of UniRef100database. On the basis of this gene index, we have identified 1,661 gene-based microsatellite sequences, of which 223 were selected for testing and 195 were successfully amplified in a test panel of 6 hexaploid (I. batatas) and 2 diploid (I. trifida) accessions. CONCLUSIONS: The sweetpotato gene index is a useful source for functionally annotated sweetpotato gene sequences that contains three times more gene sequence information for sweetpotato than previous EST assemblies. A searchable version of the gene index, including a blastn function, is available at http://www.cipotato.org/sweetpotato\_gene\_index.},
