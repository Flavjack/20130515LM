Under well water conditions, soil can supply water at a steady rate to meet the transpiration demand. However, as the soil becomes dry, water flux from soil to root surface decreases and cannot satisfy the demand of transpiration. Water stress reduces photosynthetic efficiency which is mainly caused by stomatal limitation and have a negative effect during tuber initiation and bulking reducing the production of photo-assimilates and plant growth [@onder2005Different; @obidiegwu2015Coping; @plich2020Relations]. 



Among the earliest plant responses to soil water deficiency is stomatal closure protecting the plant against excessive loss of water but it concomitantly restricts CO2 gas exchange (Feller & Vaseva, 2014; Obidiegwu et al., 2015). 

A substantial increase in the efficiency of water use by Gwiazda was achieved by early stomata closure, and the sensitivity to ABA resulted in a significant reduction in transpiration rate. 

The fluorescence quantum yield (Fv/Fm), the most widely used photosystem II efficiency indicator, did not change in tolerant potato cultivars (Gwiazda and Tajfun) under drought, but a small decrease in the Fv/ Fm ratio was associated with a lower drought tolerance in sensitive cultivars (Owacja and Oberon) [@boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent]. 

Potato genotypes did not show differences in Fv/Fm values even at relative water deficits below 40% (Tourneux, Devaux, Camacho, Mamani, & Ledent, 2003) and during field drought, which were sufficient to lower the yield of tubers (Schafleitner et al., 2007). This indicates that photosystem II was unaffected by water deficiency, which implies that chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were unable to distinguish between drought-tolerant and -susceptible potato cultivars [@boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent].


Young leaves generally have the highest metabolic activity and presumably the highest photosynthetic capacity under drought as they are less affected by turgor losses than older ones. Hence, synthesis of drought-adaptive proteins such as dehydrins and heat shock proteins is preferentially maintained in younger leaves contributing to increasing total protein contents [@meise2018Impact].

High N contents in leaves were negatively correlated with RWC. Therefore, an excess of leaf N promoted turgor decline under drought emphasizing the importance of a well-balanced N fertilization under water limitation [@meise2018Impact; @saravia2016Yield]. 

breeding of potatoes with advanced drought tolerance by improvement of OA is considered doubtful. Other traits with relevance for drought tolerance as possibly proline accumulation and extended root systems appear more promising for improving drought tolerance in potatoes [@meise2018Impact].

In potato plant, an optimal xylem-phloem transport interaction is critical considering the competition for photoassimilates between the above-ground and underground tissues (Kooman and Rabbinge 1996). 

Drought conditions interfere with stem structure and availability of transport materials (Banik et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2009).

However, our fndings [@aliche2020Morphological] support the hypothesis that stem growth reduction during dehydration may also serve an advantageous purpose for the plantsâ€”to reduce transport distance (Koch et al. 2004). This suggests that stem growth reduction under limited water availability can facilitate an efcient water and nutrient transport in plants. 

The stomatal closure of source leaves under dehydration in our greenhouse study as was observed in Biogold and Hansa [@aliche2020Morphological] may imply that the sink leaves needed to adapt carbon fxation rate, as was shown in another study where younger leaves maintained their stomatal conductance and photosynthesis despite the decline of these attributes in older leaves (Vos and Oyarzun 1987).

ABA signalling is induced by osmotic stress, and is also known to induce the expression of dehydrins (osmoprotectants), which function as chaperones in plant drought responses (Hanin et al., 2011). In our study, we observed that the expression of a dehydrin gene, TAS14, was upregulated under drought up to several hundred-folds [@aliche2020Morphological].

In our study [@aliche2020Morphological], however, the chlorophyll fluorescence of drought-stressed plants did not significantly differ from those of the irrigated plants. Jefferies (1994) demonstrated in field grown potato (cv. Maris Piper) that drought had no significant effect on PSII function because excess light energy was dissipated by photorespiration. 

The dark green-coloured drought-stressed leaves also had higher chlorophyll density [@aliche2020Morphological]. 


Chlorophyll Content of Source leaves and Chlorophyll Content of Sink leaves have a positive relation with non-iirgated plant and negative relation with tuber dry weight [@aliche2020Morphological]. Chlorophyll Content could be interesting tool for screen drought tolerance genotypes.

Profiling of drought-resistance mechanisms and identification of drought-resistance genes are helpful ways to achieve this goal [@chen2020Transcriptome].


Twenty-three drought-responsive genes were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive potato varieties under water stress [@chen2020Transcriptome]. 


Diploid potato species have a wide genetic background, making it easier to isolate drought-resistant genes and analyze the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance, which can be as an effective material for drought resistance research in potato [@khan2015Multiple; @yang2019Transcriptome].

The decrease in the expression level of the photosynthesis-related genes of JSY under drought stress indicates that plant water deficiency inhibits photosynthesis, and the degree of decline is greater with the increase of plant dehydration [@chen2020Transcriptome].

Transcript profiling highlighted a decrease in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins associated with PSII light harvesting complex in stress tolerant cultivars [@demirel2020Physiological].

Stress tolerant cultivars exhibited stronger expression of genes associated with plant growth and development, hormone metabolism and primary and secondary metabolism than stress susceptible cultivars  [@demirel2020Physiological]

single and multiple abiotic stress tolerance in potato is associated with a maintenance of CO2 assimilation and protection of PSII by a reduction of light harvesting capacity.he data further suggests that stress tolerant cultivars suppress cell death and maintain growth and development via fine tuning of hormone signaling, and primary and secondary metabolism [@demirel2020Physiological]. 


Tuber yield under limited water conditions is influenced by a combination of morphological and physiological processes including, photosynthesis, leaf expansion, and senescence, assimilate partitioning, tuber initiation, and tuber bulking (van Loon, 1981).

There is therefore a clear need to understand the responses to combined abiotic stresses under real-world conditions, to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which crops can maintain yield and quality in the face of abiotic stress and to define markers that can be efficiently applied in breeding to generate potato varieties that are more tolerant to combined abiotic stress [@demirel2020Physiological].

Desiree and Unica (heat tolerant) both exhibited a significant reduction in the abundance of transcripts associated with PSII, particularly transcripts encoding light harvesting chlorophyllprotein complex components, when exposed to drought and heat [@demirel2020Physiological]


[@demirel2020Physiological] These data suggest that tolerant cultivars acclimate to stress by reducing their light harvesting capacity thereby minimizing the potential for cellular damage resulting from the production of excessive ROS in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Similarly, only the stress tolerant genotypes exhibited an elevated leaf temperature under heat and drought stress in comparison with heat alone. This would be consistent with the induction of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and the increased radiation of absorbed light energy as heat (Ruban, 2016)

[@demirel2020Physiological]  The transcription factor ABI5 is a key regulator of ABA signaling and stress responses and its function is modulated by AFP2 (Garcia et al., 2008). This provides a mechanism for fine-tuning stress responses and so its differential expression between heat tolerant and heat sensitive potato varieties is highly significant. 

[@demirel2020Physiological] We chose to impart stress treatments at the tuber initiation stage as this has been shown to limit foliage, stolon and tuber development and yield (Obidiegwu et al., 2015).

[@demirel2020Physiological]  These experiments indicate that stress tolerant cultivars respond to stress by i) reducing light harvesting capacity and increasing non-photochemical quenching and ii) maintaining capacity for growth and development in part by iii) rerouting metabolism to compensate for reduced photosynthesis. This is achieved by a fine tuning of hormonal signaling. The responses of cultivars with contrasting abiotic stress tolerance provided information on genes/classes of compounds that may be used as targets for future studies aimed at enhancing multi-stress tolerance in potato.

[@li2020Enhanced] The transgenic potato plants showed normal phenotypes under drought stress, while the non-transgenic plants appeared withered. Results of physiological parameters assays showed that malondialdehyde, relative water content, and chlorophyll content in the transgenic potato plants were higher than that of non-transgenic plants. Upon rehydration after two weeks of drought, proline and soluble sugar contents of the transgenic potato plants were significantly higher than those of non-transgenic plants. These results combined demonstrate that the StProDH1 is a key player in the process of potato response to drought stress.


[@li2020Enhanced] we cloned two potato ProDH genes StProDH1 and StProDH2 from the potato cultivar â€˜Favoritaâ€™, and silencing the StProDH1 gene by the amiRNA technology. Our results suggested that the proline content increased in the transgenic potato plants and was companied by an enhanced tolerance to drought. This result expands our understanding of the role of ProDH in potato. 

[@li2020Enhanced]  proline to be a compatible osmolyte, carbon, nitrogen storage, and ROS scavenger (Hare and Cress. 1997). In addition, proline accumulation may be involved in stress signaling response (Smirnoff and Cumbes. 1989). ProDH is a rate litmiting enzyme in proline catabolism, and is found a universally enzyme in all kingdoms of life (Servet et al., 2012).



[@li2020Enhanced] the transgenic potato plants with improved drought tolerance were successfully generated by silencing the StProDH1 gene. The transgenic plants showed enhanced proline and soluble sugar content, photosynthesis efficiency and membrane stability under drought stress. 



Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third most important crop species worldwide after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption, and its global production exceeds 388 million metric tons per year (Deuvax et al. 2014, FAOSTAT 2019)

[@plich2020Relations] It is well known that photosynthetic activity is reduced when plants are exposed to environmental stress (Retuerto et al. 2006; Prinzenberg et al. 2018). Drought stress reduces plant growth by reducing photosynthesis, which is mainly caused by stomatal limitation. Decreases in stomatal conductance reduce water loss through transpiration, but it also decreases carbon dioxide uptake, reducing the production of photoassimilates and plant growth.

[@plich2020Relations] These results suggest that measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence may serve as a useful tool for estimating the level of tolerance to drought stress in potato.

With the change in environment and the scarcity of resources, abiotic stress has become an important factor which restricts the growing development of plants, having serious impact on quality of the agricultural products (Thao and Tran, 2012).

[@qi2020potato] In this study, it found that the StRFP2 gene was significantly up-regulated during drought stress which shows similar result as in previous transcriptome studies in potato under drought stress. 

[@reddy2020Leaf] Increased water use efficiency (WUE) by virtue of higher carbon assimilatory capacity can significantly circumvent this trade-off. Here, we report leaf mass area (LMA) has an important canopy architecture trait which when combined with superior carboxylation efficiency (CE) would achieve higher water productivity in rice.

[@reddy2020Leaf]  Increased WUE through improved chloroplast capacity to fix carbon has a greater relevance in enhancing water productivity in rice.

The Car/Chl ratio in all cultivars under drought stress was also higher than that in WW plants [@rodriguez-perez2017Drought]. The Car content and Car/Chl ratio are correlated with the capacity of light protecting mechanisms (Boardman, 1977). 

Stomatal and non-stomatal limitations cause an imbalance between the two phases of photosynthesis and an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Sanchez-RodrÃ­guez et al., 2010; Farhad et al., 2011). 


The WUE was found to be greater in the summer due to the greater harvest index (HI) and more-efficient interception of solar radiation per unit of applied water by drought-exposed than by well-watered plots [@trebejo1990Effect]. 

In normal conditions when irrigation is sufficient to meet the transpiration needs of the crop, genotypes with higher stomatal conductance and low WUE, able to extract more water from the soil, will have higher yield. In contrast, when water is not sufficient, the low WUE arising from a high rate of transpiration leads to low yields in favor of dry matter partitioning to reproductive organs [@tuberosa2012Phenotyping].
