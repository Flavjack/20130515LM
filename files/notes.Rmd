The leaf chlorophyll content was lower in the high-WUE group indicating that the higher net photosynthesis rate was not due to higher leaf-N status [@kaminski2015Contrasting].


Agriculture accounts for around 85 % of global water consumption (Shiklomanov and Rodda 2003), and the amount of water used for crop irrigation is predicted to double by 2050 (Tilman et al. 2002).

It is therefore essential for future studies to focus, in addition to improving the agricultural irrigation systems, on breeding crops with increased water-use efficiency (WUE), also at well-watered conditions [@kaminski2015Contrasting].


The regulation of potato (Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum) stomatal conductance has been of special interest, as this crop is sensitive to drought and closes its stomata at relatively mild soil moisture deficits (Lynch et al. 1995, Sadras and Milroy 1996, Porter et al. 1999, Onder et al. 2005) resulting in considerable yield loss (Porter et al. 1999). An appropriate irrigation is therefore necessary to achieve desirable yield and quality (Liu et al. 2006). It has been shown that partial root zone drying (PRD), a technique where water is supplied alternately to two spatially separated parts of the potatoes root system, saves 30 % of irrigation water without reducing the overall yield (Shahnazariet al. 2007). 


(ABA) based root-to-shoot chemical signalling system has been found to be effective in increasing WUE by partial stomatal closure, where water losses due to transpiration decrease significantly yet not affecting the photosynthetic potential of potato (Liu et al. 2005, 2006).


Potatoes use water more efficiently than cereals. The potato harvest index is approximately 0.75 and can reach as high as 0.86 (Shahnazari et al. 2007), in contrast to cereals for which it oscillates around 0.5 (Vreugdenhil and Bradshaw 2007). 

Breeding potato with increased WUE is essential to meet the demand of a continuously increasing world population with little possibility to include previously unexploited arable land. However, phenotyping WUE is not a simple process due to cost, space and labour requirements [@kaminski2015Contrasting].

The physiological mechanisms of potato plants response to various environmental conditions require deeper understanding. In addition, potato is an autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) and suffers from acute inbreeding depression (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium 2011), which contributes to a significant barrier for traditional breeding approaches [@kaminski2015Contrasting].

[@rolando2015Leaf]{

However, in the three genotypes tested, an increase in greenness was noted one week after the initiation of water restriction and maintained for 4–6 weeks.

In our work, a decrease in leaf growth a week after the initiation of water restriction coincided with the leaf greenness increase. Reduced leaf growth under water restriction was evidenced by both reduced leaf length and total above ground biomass accumulation, the latter measured three weeks after the restriction started. 

Unica had the highest DSI, its final TB under water restriction was higher than Désirée. DSI compares the ratio between TB under water restricted and control treatments, thus Unica higher DSI is the result of a much higher TB under control treatment than Désirée. This higher TB, among other reasons, is a result of a longer vegetative period during which the crop accumulated biomass (Tardieu, 2013).

Finally, as the increase of greenness promoted by water stress likely depends on the stage of application and intensity of water restriction, further research on the timing effect of drought stress on the senescence process and its impact on the photosynthetic apparatus should be considered.

Drought stress reduce the harvest index in 11% for WD plants, similar results were found in potato _(Schafleitner et al., 2007)_ with 14% under terminal drought and more drastic with 57% Jerusalem artichoke [@ruttanaprasert2016Effects] showing that potato have moderate reduction under drought stress including in the present study that the number of tuber did not have variation between treatments.

_Jefferies (1992)_ found that long term drought stress increased harvest index of potato in some early maturity varieties (from 0.41 to 0.50) but reduced one late maturity variety (from 0.54 to 0.25). 

Nevertheless, harvest index of a tuber crop is an important trait determining yield under drought conditions _(Deguchi et al., 2010)_.


[@saravia2016Yield]{

UNICA was the most efficient genotype at using the N present in the soil and tolerating drought stress, while Achirana-INTA was most affected by drought in terms of NUE. 

Both UNICA and CIP397077.16 tolerated drought in terms of yield maintenance and used the N present in the soil more efficiently, also under drought, than Achirana-INTA.

@saravia2016Yield show that UNICA and CIP397077.16 while they did not have difference for harvest index under well water and drought treatment the Chl~spad~ can discriminate the relation between the tuber yield under drought stress with less Chl~spad~ shown that Chl~spad~ could allow to discriminate drought tolerance genotypes under field conditions.

A fast screening tool would be helpful in selecting valuable genotypes with defined growth strategies that translate to drought tolerance and are suitable for experiments and/or breeding [@soltys-kalina2016effect].

Differentiation of the architecture of the potato root system were found in several potato cultivars in the field [@zarzynska2017Differences]. but in our case root lengt and root dry weight have the no statistical differences. In our tent experiment, root growth of all cultivars was limited by the volume of plastic bags, in which plants were grown. Among tested potato cultivars no large differences in plant architecture or canopy size were observed [@soltys-kalina2016effect].

The closure of stomata also reduces the rate of transpiration and results in the retention of water by the plant. Taken together, lowered rates of transpiration and photosynthesis directly affect water use efficiency (WUE) and drought tolerance (Chaerle, Saibo, & van der Straeten, 2005).


From an agronomical point of view, maintaining yield levels during drought is crucial for breeders, and thus, the drought tolerance of cultivars has been quantified from tuber yield under irrigated and soil drought conditions [@boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent].

In the potato, yield is more affected by water deficiency during tuber formation than any other developmental stage (Ierna & Mauromicale, 2012; Obidiegwu et al., 2015).

Among the earliest plant responses to soil water deficiency is stomatal closure protecting the plant against excessive loss of water but it concomitantly restricts CO2 gas exchange (Feller & Vaseva, 2014; Obidiegwu et al., 2015). 

A substantial increase in the efficiency of water use by Gwiazda was achieved by early stomata closure, and the sensitivity to ABA resulted in a significant reduction in transpiration rate. 

The fluorescence quantum yield (Fv/Fm), the most widely used photosystem II efficiency indicator, did not change in tolerant potato cultivars (Gwiazda and Tajfun) under drought, but a small decrease in the Fv/ Fm ratio was associated with a lower drought tolerance in sensitive cultivars (Owacja and Oberon) [@boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent]. 

Potato genotypes did not show differences in Fv/Fm values even at relative water deficits below 40% (Tourneux, Devaux, Camacho, Mamani, & Ledent, 2003) and during field drought, which were sufficient to lower the yield of tubers (Schafleitner et al., 2007). This indicates that photosystem II was unaffected by water deficiency, which implies that chlorophyll fluorescence measurements were unable to distinguish between drought-tolerant and -susceptible potato cultivars [@boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent].


Young leaves generally have the highest metabolic activity and presumably the highest photosynthetic capacity under drought as they are less affected by turgor losses than older ones. Hence, synthesis of drought-adaptive proteins such as dehydrins and heat shock proteins is preferentially maintained in younger leaves contributing to increasing total protein contents [@meise2018Impact].

High N contents in leaves were negatively correlated with RWC. Therefore, an excess of leaf N promoted turgor decline under drought emphasizing the importance of a well-balanced N fertilization under water limitation [@meise2018Impact; @saravia2016Yield]. 

breeding of potatoes with advanced drought tolerance by improvement of OA is considered doubtful. Other traits with relevance for drought tolerance as possibly proline accumulation and extended root systems appear more promising for improving drought tolerance in potatoes [@meise2018Impact].

In potato plant, an optimal xylem-phloem transport interaction is critical considering the competition for photoassimilates between the above-ground and underground tissues (Kooman and Rabbinge 1996). 

Drought conditions interfere with stem structure and availability of transport materials (Banik et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2009).

However, our fndings [@aliche2020Morphological] support the hypothesis that stem growth reduction during dehydration may also serve an advantageous purpose for the plants—to reduce transport distance (Koch et al. 2004). This suggests that stem growth reduction under limited water availability can facilitate an efcient water and nutrient transport in plants. 

The stomatal closure of source leaves under dehydration in our greenhouse study as was observed in Biogold and Hansa [@aliche2020Morphological] may imply that the sink leaves needed to adapt carbon fxation rate, as was shown in another study where younger leaves maintained their stomatal conductance and photosynthesis despite the decline of these attributes in older leaves (Vos and Oyarzun 1987).

ABA signalling is induced by osmotic stress, and is also known to induce the expression of dehydrins (osmoprotectants), which function as chaperones in plant drought responses (Hanin et al., 2011). In our study, we observed that the expression of a dehydrin gene, TAS14, was upregulated under drought up to several hundred-folds [@aliche2020Morphological].

In our study [@aliche2020Morphological], however, the chlorophyll fluorescence of drought-stressed plants did not significantly differ from those of the irrigated plants. Jefferies (1994) demonstrated in field grown potato (cv. Maris Piper) that drought had no significant effect on PSII function because excess light energy was dissipated by photorespiration. 

The dark green-coloured drought-stressed leaves also had higher chlorophyll density [@aliche2020Morphological]. 


Chlorophyll Content of Source leaves and Chlorophyll Content of Sink leaves have a positive relation with non-iirgated plant and negative relation with tuber dry weight [@aliche2020Morphological]. Chlorophyll Content could be interesting tool for screen drought tolerance genotypes.

Profiling of drought-resistance mechanisms and identification of drought-resistance genes are helpful ways to achieve this goal [@chen2020Transcriptome].


Twenty-three drought-responsive genes were identified by comparing the transcriptomes of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive potato varieties under water stress [@chen2020Transcriptome]. 


Some genes will have memory effect on stress in this process and will show higher expression level when drought occurs again [@chen2020Transcriptome].

Diploid potato species have a wide genetic background, making it easier to isolate drought-resistant genes and analyze the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance, which can be as an effective material for drought resistance research in potato [@khan2015Multiple; @yang2019Transcriptome].

The decrease in the expression level of the photosynthesis-related genes of JSY under drought stress indicates that plant water deficiency inhibits photosynthesis, and the degree of decline is greater with the increase of plant dehydration [@chen2020Transcriptome].

Transcript profiling highlighted a decrease in the abundance of transcripts encoding proteins associated with PSII light harvesting complex in stress tolerant cultivars [@demirel2020Physiological].

Stress tolerant cultivars exhibited stronger expression of genes associated with plant growth and development, hormone metabolism and primary and secondary metabolism than stress susceptible cultivars  [@demirel2020Physiological]

single and multiple abiotic stress tolerance in potato is associated with a maintenance of CO2 assimilation and protection of PSII by a reduction of light harvesting capacity.he data further suggests that stress tolerant cultivars suppress cell death and maintain growth and development via fine tuning of hormone signaling, and primary and secondary metabolism [@demirel2020Physiological]. 




Tuber yield under limited water conditions is influenced by a combination of morphological and physiological processes including, photosynthesis, leaf expansion, and senescence, assimilate partitioning, tuber initiation, and tuber bulking (van Loon, 1981).

There is therefore a clear need to understand the responses to combined abiotic stresses under real-world conditions, to elucidate molecular mechanisms by which crops can maintain yield and quality in the face of abiotic stress and to define markers that can be efficiently applied in breeding to generate potato varieties that are more tolerant to combined abiotic stress [@demirel2020Physiological].

Desiree and Unica (heat tolerant) both exhibited a significant reduction in the abundance of transcripts associated with PSII, particularly transcripts encoding light harvesting chlorophyllprotein complex components, when exposed to drought and heat [@demirel2020Physiological]


[@demirel2020Physiological] These data suggest that tolerant cultivars acclimate to stress by reducing their light harvesting capacity thereby minimizing the potential for cellular damage resulting from the production of excessive ROS in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Similarly, only the stress tolerant genotypes exhibited an elevated leaf temperature under heat and drought stress in comparison with heat alone. This would be consistent with the induction of non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence and the increased radiation of absorbed light energy as heat (Ruban, 2016)


[@demirel2020Physiological]  The transcription factor ABI5 is a key regulator of ABA signaling and stress responses and its function is modulated by AFP2 (Garcia et al., 2008). This provides a mechanism for fine-tuning stress responses and so its differential expression between heat tolerant and heat sensitive potato varieties is highly significant. 

[@demirel2020Physiological] We chose to impart stress treatments at the tuber initiation stage as this has been shown to limit foliage, stolon and tuber development and yield (Obidiegwu et al., 2015).

[@demirel2020Physiological]  These experiments indicate that stress tolerant cultivars respond to stress by i) reducing light harvesting capacity and increasing non-photochemical quenching and ii) maintaining capacity for growth and development in part by iii) rerouting metabolism to compensate for reduced photosynthesis. This is achieved by a fine tuning of hormonal signaling. The responses of cultivars with contrasting abiotic stress tolerance provided information on genes/classes of compounds that may be used as targets for future studies aimed at enhancing multi-stress tolerance in potato.

[@li2020Enhanced] The transgenic potato plants showed normal phenotypes under drought stress, while the non-transgenic plants appeared withered. Results of physiological parameters assays showed that malondialdehyde, relative water content, and chlorophyll content in the transgenic potato plants were higher than that of non-transgenic plants. Upon rehydration after two weeks of drought, proline and soluble sugar contents of the transgenic potato plants were significantly higher than those of non-transgenic plants. These results combined demonstrate that the StProDH1 is a key player in the process of potato response to drought stress.


[@li2020Enhanced] we cloned two potato ProDH genes StProDH1 and StProDH2 from the potato cultivar ‘Favorita’, and silencing the StProDH1 gene by the amiRNA technology. Our results suggested that the proline content increased in the transgenic potato plants and was companied by an enhanced tolerance to drought. This result expands our understanding of the role of ProDH in potato. 

[@li2020Enhanced]  proline to be a compatible osmolyte, carbon, nitrogen storage, and ROS scavenger (Hare and Cress. 1997). In addition, proline accumulation may be involved in stress signaling response (Smirnoff and Cumbes. 1989). ProDH is a rate litmiting enzyme in proline catabolism, and is found a universally enzyme in all kingdoms of life (Servet et al., 2012).



[@li2020Enhanced] the transgenic potato plants with improved drought tolerance were successfully generated by silencing the StProDH1 gene. The transgenic plants showed enhanced proline and soluble sugar content, photosynthesis efficiency and membrane stability under drought stress. 



Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is the third most important crop species worldwide after rice and wheat in terms of human consumption, and its global production exceeds 388 million metric tons per year (Deuvax et al. 2014, FAOSTAT 2019)

[@plich2020Relations] It is well known that photosynthetic activity is reduced when plants are exposed to environmental stress (Retuerto et al. 2006; Prinzenberg et al. 2018). Drought stress reduces plant growth by reducing photosynthesis, which is mainly caused by stomatal limitation. Decreases in stomatal conductance reduce water loss through transpiration, but it also decreases carbon dioxide uptake, reducing the production of photoassimilates and plant growth.

[@plich2020Relations] These results suggest that measurements of chlorophyll a fluorescence may serve as a useful tool for estimating the level of tolerance to drought stress in potato.

With the change in environment and the scarcity of resources, abiotic stress has become an important factor which restricts the growing development of plants, having serious impact on quality of the agricultural products (Thao and Tran, 2012).


[@qi2020potato] In this study, it found that the StRFP2 gene was significantly up-regulated during drought stress which shows similar result as in previous transcriptome studies in potato under drought stress. 

[@reddy2020Leaf] Increased water use efficiency (WUE) by virtue of higher carbon assimilatory capacity can significantly circumvent this trade-off. Here, we report leaf mass area (LMA) has an important canopy architecture trait which when combined with superior carboxylation efficiency (CE) would achieve higher water productivity in rice.

[@reddy2020Leaf]  Increased WUE through improved chloroplast capacity to fix carbon has a greater relevance in enhancing water productivity in rice.



The increase in Chl content found in Es could be associated with the decrease in leaf growth and water turgor loss, as has been described in potato (Teixeira and Pereira, 2007; Ramírez et al., 2014; Rolando et al., 2015)

The Car/Chl ratio in all cultivars under drought stress was also higher than that in WW plants [@rodriguez-perez2017Drought]. The Car content and Car/Chl ratio are correlated with the capacity of light protecting mechanisms (Boardman, 1977). 


The Chl content increased in the Es cultivar under DS from 5 to 7 DAT compared to WW plants [@rodriguez-perez2017Drought]. 

decrease in the photosynthetic rate under water deficit conditions has been reported in plants such
as potato (Solamun tuberosum L.) (Moorby et al., 1975 Schapendonk et al., 1989; Ierna and Mauromicale, 2006; Liu et al., 2006; Ramírez et al., 2016). 

Stomatal and non-stomatal limitations cause an imbalance between the two phases of photosynthesis and an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Sanchez-Rodríguez et al., 2010; Farhad et al., 2011). 


The WUE was found to be greater in the summer due to the greater harvest index (HI) and more-efficient interception of solar radiation per unit of applied water by drought-exposed than by well-watered plots [@trebejo1990Effect]. 

In normal conditions when irrigation is sufficient to meet the transpiration needs of the crop, genotypes with higher stomatal conductance and low WUE, able to extract more water from the soil, will have higher yield. In contrast, when water is not sufficient, the low WUE arising from a high rate of transpiration leads to low yields in favor of dry matter partitioning to reproductive organs [@tuberosa2012Phenotyping].

The decrease in photosynthesis resulting from drought stress reduces growth, affecting parameters such as foliar area, total dry mass, and distribution of photoassimilates within the plants (Chaves et al., 2002; Lahlou et al., 2003). 

A previous study reported that chlorophyll was a useful factor for assessing environmental stress resistance (Gao et al., 2015).
