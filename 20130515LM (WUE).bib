  abstract = {This study was conducted to compare two water-saving techniques: deficit irrigation (DI) and partial root-zone drying (PRD) with full irrigation (FI) on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). These techniques were studied using drip irrigation in an arid region of Saudi Arabia in 2014 and 2015. Five irrigation treatments, i.e., FI (control treatment where the full amount of irrigation water was applied to both sides of the plant), DI70, DI50 (70\% and 50\% of the FI treatment, respectively, supplied to both sides of the plant), PRD70, and PRD50 (70\% and 50\% of the FI treatment, respectively, supplied to a single side of each plant in an alternating manner), were applied. The dry and wet sides of the plant in the PRD treatments were switched weekly. The soil water content was the highest in the FI treatment followed by DI70 and PRD70 and DI50 and PRD50 thereafter in 2014 and 2015. The fresh weight of the vegetative parts for both the FI and PRD70 treatments (average of 14.7Mgha-1 and 11.9Mgha-1, respectively) was significantly (p$<$0.05) higher than that of the other irrigation treatments. The FI and PRD70 treatments increased (p$<$0.05) the dry weight of the vegetative parts by approximately 48.3\%\textendash{}57.7\% relative to the other treatments in 2014. The highest number of branches per plant occurred in the PRD treatments, and the lowest number was in the DI70 treatment. The DI and PRD treatments decreased (p$<$0.01) the fresh and dry tuber yield compared to FI. The FI produced the highest number of tubers per plant. The DI treatments did not have a significantly lower irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) compared to FI in 2014, whereas PRD had significantly (p$<$0.01) lower IWUE than FI in both years.},

Leaf relative water content (RWC), leaf water potential ($\Psi$l), root water potential ($\Psi$r), stomatal conductance (gs), photosynthesis (A), and xylem sap abscisic acid (ABA) concentration ([ABA]xylem) were determined in well-watered (WW) and drought-stressed (DS) plants. At both stages, RWC and $\Psi$l were hardly affected, significant decreases of the two parameters occurred only at severe soil water deficits; however, gs decreased much early at 2 and 1 days after imposition of stress (DAIS) at tuber initiation and tuber bulking, respectively, and coincided with decrease of $\Psi$r and increase of [ABA]xylem; while A decreased 2 days later than gs at each stage. Analyses of the pooled data of the two stages showed that gs was linearly correlated with [ABA]xylem at mild soil water deficits (i.e. $\Psi$r$>$-0.3MPa); photosynthetic water use efficiency, viz. A/gs, increased linearly with decreasing gs until the latter reached 0.2molm-2s-1, below this point, it decreased sharply. The results suggest that at mild soil water deficits, gs of potato is seemingly controlled by xylem-borne ABA. As a consequence of A being less sensitive than gs to soil drying, photosynthetic water use efficiency, i.e. A/gs, is increased at mild soil water deficits.},

  abstract = {This research was conducted during the spring seasons of 2000 and 2002 in Hatay province located in the East Mediterranean Region of Turkey. The research investigated the effects of two drip irrigation methods and four different water stress levels on potato yield and yield components. The surface drip (SD) and subsurface drip (SSD) irrigation methods were used. The levels were full irrigation (I100), 66\% of full irrigation (I66), 33\% of full irrigation (I33) and un-irrigated (I0) treatments. Five and three irrigation were applied in 2000 and 2002 early potato growing seasons, respectively. Total irrigation amount changed from 102 to 302mm and from 88 to 268mm in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Seasonal evapotranspiration changed between 226 and 473mm and 166 and 391mm in 2000 and 2002, respectively. SD and SSD irrigation methods did not result in a significant difference on yield. However, SD method has more advantages than SSD method, which has difficulties in replacement and higher system cost. Irrigation levels resulted in significant difference in both years on yield and its components. Water stress significantly affected the yield and yield parameters of early potato production. Water deficiency more than 33\% of the irrigation requirement could not be suggested. Water use efficiency (WUE) of SD irrigation methods had generally higher values than SSD irrigation methods. Treatment I33 gave maximum irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) for both years. SSD irrigation method did not provide significant advantage on yield and WUE, compared to SD irrigation in early potato production under experimental conditions. Therefore, the SD irrigation method would be recommended in early potato production under Mediterranean conditions.},

In FI, the whole root system was irrigated at 100\% of evapotranspiration (ETfull); in DI 50\% of ETfull was irrigated to the whole root system; in PRD 50\% of ETfull was irrigated to one soil column while the other was allowed to dry, and irrigation was shifted when 80\textendash{}85\% of plant available water in the dry side had been used. Midday leaf water potential was similar for all treatments at 9 days after onset of treatments (DAT), while it was significantly lower in PRD than in FI and DI plants at 21 DAT. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration were generally greater in FI plants. Compared to FI, both DI and PRD significantly decreased leaf area and biomass. DI decreased biomass allocation to leaves and stems while increasing it into roots and tubers. PRD increased biomass allocation to roots. ET under PRD was ca. 80\% of DI and FI until six DAT, thereafter ET of DI and PRD was similar and was significantly less than that of FI. Water use of DI and PRD plants was 37\% less than that of FI. Water use efficiency (WUE) and transpiration efficiency were similar for PRD and FI plants, and were significantly less than those of DI plants. Conclusively, given the same amount (50\% of ETfull) of irrigation, PRD has no advantages compared to DI in terms of biomass production and WUE in potato at tuber initiation stage.},

  abstract = {Transpiration-use efficiency, the ratio of biomass (Y) produced per unit of water transpired (T) by a crop, depends on crop characteristics and on the environment in which crops develop. Transpiration-use efficiency has been described as Y/T = kc/Da, where kc is a crop dependent constant and Da is the daytime air vapor pressure deficit. Our objectives were to determine Y/T and kc of barley grown in Pullman, WA, and to analyze the variation in Y/T and kc of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) reported in the literature. Transpiration and biomass accumulation of barley crops were measured in the years 2000 and 2001. The coefficient kc was estimated as the slope of the regression between cumulative values of biomass and T/Da. It ranged from 6.6 \AE{} 0.4 to 6.9 \AE{} 0.2 Pa. These figures are greater than 5.8 Pa obtained by applying equations developed by Tanner and Sinclair [Tanner, C.B., Sinclair, T.R., 1983. Efficient water use in crop production: research or re-search. In: Taylor, H.M., et al. (Eds.), Limitations to Efficient Water Use in Crop Production. ASA, Madison, WI, pp. 1\textendash{}27]. Data on kc reported in the literature, although scarce, ranged from 3.0 to 5.9 Pa for barley, and from 2.8 to 6.7 Pa for wheat, with the lower values occurring at low Da ($<$1 kPa). This variability seems to associate with the response of the internal (leaf) to external (bulk air) CO2 concentration ratio (ci/ca) to changes of the leaf-to-air vapor pressure deficit (Dl), suggesting that kc rather than a constant could be a function of Dl. The evaluation of more field data on kc, the field validation of the response of ci/ca to Dl, and testing this approach for different species and cultivars is needed to improve the understanding of the Y/T determination at the canopy level. \# 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  doi = {10.1071/FP11101},
  abstract = {Drought resistance is being increasingly labelled as being a `complex trait', especially with the recent expansion of research into its genomics. There is a danger that this label may turn into an axiom that is liable to damage education on the subject as well as research and the delivery of solutions to the farmer. This opinionated review examines whether there is grounds for such an axiom. Drought resistance is labelled as a `complex trait' mainly when viewed by molecular biologists from the gene discovery platform. This platform is capable of expressing hundreds and thousands of drought-responsive genes, which are up- or down-regulated under dehydration stress according to growth stage, plant organ or even time of day. Sorting out the `grain out of the chaff' in order to identify the function of the candidate genes towards drought resistance is difficult and, thus, the idea that drought resistance is complex is raised. However, when drought resistance is viewed from the physiological and agronomic whole-plant and crop platform, it appears much simpler; its control, whether constitutive or adaptive, is rather obvious with respect to manipulation in breeding and crop management. The most important and common drought resistance traits function to maintain plant hydration under drought stress due to effective use of water (EUW). The state of our knowledge and the achievements in breeding for drought resistance do not support labelling drought resistance as a complex trait. The genomics road towards drought resistance is complex but we already know that the destination is much simpler.},

  abstract = {In the lowlands of Central Asia, summer grown potato is increasingly affected by soil moisture deficit due to inadequate irrigation and high evaporative demand. Many farmers cannot apply irrigation schedules that fully respond to the water demand because of reduced water availability throughout the Aral Sea basin, caused by global warming, and the competing use of irrigation by the cotton crop. The effects of different irrigation regimes were evaluated on ten potato clones in the lowlands of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, during the summer cropping season (July\textendash{}October) of three consecutive years (2008, 2009 and 2010). The applicability of a growth model to predict yield under the different water regimes was tested. Significant treatment and genotype effects on yield and yield components were observed. The significant correlation for tuber yield among treatments suggested that yield under water limitation was driven more by potential yield than water restriction tolerance. Tuber yield was more associated to tuber weight than to tuber number, a component already largely determined when the different water treatments were initiated. The reduction of water supply after tuberization had a limited effect on yield and consequently drastically enhanced water use efficiency. It increased starch and dry matter content, but decreased vitamin C content. Some clones maintained high yield across years and treatments and appeared as good candidates for being recommended to farmers. Others showed interesting quality traits and are proposed for use as progenitors in breeding programs targeting at the improvement of the nutritional value of potato. A good prediction of yield was obtained using the growth model except for year 2009 when trials were heavily affected by weed infestation. The present study contributes to the improvement of water management and the identification of clones with high tuber yield and quality for the lowlands of Tashkent. Additional experiments are required to address the constraints to potato cultivation in other agro-climatic zones of Central Asia.},

Photosynthesis in the Andigena landraces during prolonged drought was maintained significantly longer than in the Tuberosum (Atlantic) line. Among the Andigena landraces, `Sullu' (SUL) was more drought resistant than `Negra Ojosa' (NOJ). Microarray analysis and metabolite data from leaf samples taken at the point of maximum stress suggested higher mitochondrial metabolic activity in SUL than in NOJ. A greater induction of chloroplast-localized antioxidant and chaperone genes in SUL compared with NOJ was evident. ABA-responsive TFs were more induced in NOJ compared with SUL, including WRKY1, mediating a response in SA signalling that may give rise to increased ROS. NOJ may be experiencing higher ROS levels than SUL. Metabolite profiles of NOJ were characterized by compounds indicative of stress, for example, proline, trehalose, and GABA, which accumulated to a higher degree than in SUL. The differences between the Andigena lines were not explained by protective roles of compatible solutes; hexoses and complex sugars were similar in both landraces. Instead, lower levels of ROS accumulation, greater mitochondrial activity and active chloroplast defences contributed to a lower stress load in SUL than in NOJ during drought.},

To this end, accurate, relevant phenotyping plays an increasingly pivotal role for the selection of drought-resilient genotypes and, more in general, for a meaningful dissection of the quantitative genetic landscape that underscores the adaptive response of crops to drought. A major and universally recognized obstacle to a more effective translation of the results produced by drought-related studies into improved cultivars is the difficulty in properly phenotyping in a high-throughput fashion in order to identify the quantitative trait loci that govern yield and related traits across different water regimes. This review provides basic principles and a broad set of references useful for the management of phenotyping practices for the study and genetic dissection of drought tolerance and, ultimately, for the release of drought-tolerant cultivars.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to define sensitive morphological indicators that could be used to discriminate between drought sensitive and drought tolerant potato cultivars before final tuber yield is reached. A total of six potato cultivars contrasting for drought tolerance and earliness were subjected to three levels of water supply in two field trials in 1995 and 1996. We examined which parameter among stem height, number of green leaves and leaf length (the two latter parameters were only measured on two cultivars) was most sensitive to moderate drought conditions and responded similarly to water shortage regarding tuber yield, tuber number and average tuber dry weight. Drought reduced the number of green leaves in cultivars Krostar and De\textasciiacute{}sire\textasciiacute{}e, respectively, up to 22 and 25\% 124 days after planting during the season but this effect levelled off towards the end of the season. Drought also induced significant length reductions (29, 43 and 53\%, respectively, for the leaf numbers 17, 18 and 19) but there were no differences among the two cultivars examined. Stem height was sensitive to drought and the effect was stronger on later cultivars especially when water shortage started early as in 1996. In 1996, stem height ratios were negatively related (R2 = 0.80) to TDWS (tuber yield ratio indicative of drought tolerance) whereas they were positively related in 1995 (R2 = 0.21). However, care is needed as the negative relationship of 1996 was associated to earliness of cultivars. Indeed, stem height was less reduced in early cultivars (13 and 14\% for Eersteling and Jaerla, respectively) than in mid-late cultivars (25 and 29\% for De\textasciiacute{}sire\textasciiacute{}e and Nicola, respectively). In the drought treatment, no supernumerary tuber was observed across the season contrary to the irrigated treatment. According to the year, final tuber number or average tuber dry weight was reduced by the drought treatment. Reduction in tuber number (17\%) in the drought treatment was not associated to lower tuber yields due to compensation by average tuber dry weight (6\%). Different growth strategies can be followed by the potato plant to adapt to different drought conditions without tuber yield being significantly affected. \textcopyright{} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {In the northern spring\textendash{}summer season of 2004\textendash{}2005, vegetative propagated plants of Spartina alterniflora were grown under control and water stress conditions on the Mediterranean sea shore of the south-east of Tunis. Control plants were irrigated every week and water stress plants were irrigated until the soil achieved 50\% (mild stress) and 25\% (severe stress) field capacity (FC). Dry and fresh weight at the whole plant level (g plant-1), shoot to root ratio on dry and fresh weight, photosynthesis (A), transpiration rate (E), instantaneous water-use efficiency (WUEi), leaf water potential (\guillemotleft{} w), leaf water content (WC), osmotic potential at full turgor (\guillemotleft{} s100), osmotic potential at turgor loss point (\guillemotleft{} s0), osmotic adjustment (OA), proline, sugars, inorganic compounds and cell wall elasticity (CWE) were evaluated during a period of 6 days period between 82 and 90 days after the beginning of treatment (DAT). Plants grown under severe and mild-water stress showed lower \guillemotleft{} w than in control plants with values that averaged -3.1, -1.6 and -0.9 MPa, respectively. S. alterniflora plants submitted to mild-water stress exhibited OA and a decrease in CWE. However, under severe water stress the OA was not observed and CWE also decreased, but it was higher than in the mild-water stress. OA was mainly explained by the accumulation of nitrates, sugars and at a lesser degree, proline. S. alterniflora had a strong decline of the dry and fresh weight of the whole plant associated to a marked decrease of photosynthesis (A) and transpiration (E) in response to water stress, although WUEi was increased. These results suggest that OA and WUEi can be important components of the water stress adaptation mechanism in this species, but they are not sufficient enough to contribute to resistance to water stress.},

  volume = {60},

  doi = {10.1071/CP09064},
  abstract = {Water-use efficiency (WUE) is defined here as the ratio of grain yield (kg/ha) to crop water use by evapotranspiration (mm). Much of the WUE literature has focussed on either the determination of the boundary of attainable WUE for any amount of available water, or on the practicalities of measurement of the WUE of a crop. While these are important issues for defining the gap between the attained and the potential WUE, little progress has been reported on clarifying the components that contribute to this gap or on how it can be bridged. To address these questions, we analysed 334 wheat fields for which we had the data necessary to both calculate WUE and to simulate crop growth and water use. Simulations were conducted through Yield Prophet\textregistered, an on-line version of the APSIM systems model. For this dataset, evapotranspiration accounted for 69\% of observed yield variation, although the more commonly used growing-season (April\textendash{}October) rainfall accounted for 50\%. Considering that evapotranspiration efficiency does not account for a wide range of potentially yield-limiting factors including soil and fertiliser nitrogen supply, crop phenology, and sowing dates, or rainfall distribution, these results reinforce the importance of evapotranspiration efficiency as a yield determinant for well managed crops in water-limited environments. WUE attained over the whole dataset was 15.2 kg grain/ha.mm (x-intercept = 67 mm), although this value contained data subsets with important differences in WUE based on soil water-holding capacity and regional diversity. Yield Prophet\textregistered{} simulated commercial wheat yields with RMSDs of 0.80 t/ha (r2 = 0.71), with some systematic error between observed and simulated yields. Simulated crops achieved a higher WUE (16.9 kg grain/ha.mm; x-intercept = 72 mm) than the observed crops, probably because APSIM does not account for effects of factors such as weeds, pests and diseases and impacts of severe weather. Simulated `what-if' analysis suggested that further improvement in WUE may be achieved with an early sowing strategy or a higher nitrogen input strategy. A `yield maximising' strategy that included an optimal plant density, early sowing date, and higher nitrogen inputs resulted in an average WUE (21.4 kg grain/ha.mm; x-intercept = 80 mm) that is close to the previously reported (French-Schultz) boundary of WUE. This outcome suggests a great deal of scope for Australian wheat growers to adopt strategies that improve their WUE. Yield Prophet\textregistered{} farmers have already demonstrated significant improvement in on-farm WUE compared with previous studies. However, additional improvements will only be partially realised due to considerations of the cost: benefit ratio and risk in a highly variable climate, and the operational feasibility of these strategies with current technologies.},

The response of the plants was analysed for three distinct stages of dehydration. In stage I, the rate of transpiration remained constant and equal to that of well watered plants even though soil water status fell by more than 50\%. Stage I1 began when the rate of soil water supply to the plant was less than potential transpiration and stomates closed resultingjn the maintenance of plant water balance. When soil water content was expressed as a fraction of transpirable soil water, all species showed a transition from stage I to stage I1 at a fraction of transpirable soil water of about 0.3 to 0.2. As the soil water declined further, all species had a similar decrease in relative transpiration rate. Consequently, the responses of the four species in stages I and I1 were essentially identical, except that pigeonpea extracted a slightly greater amount of soil water.},

  abstract = {Quercus ilex and Phillyrea latifolia growing in a holm oak forest in Prades mountains (NE Spain) were subjected to experimental drought conditions. Soil water availability was reduced about 15\% by plastic strips and funnels that partially excluded rain throughfall and by ditch exclusion of water runoff. Diurnal courses of maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm), apparent photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR), net photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E) and water use efficiency (WUE) were measured in sunlit and shade leaves of both species during 2 years. Moreover, the responses of photosynthetic rates to PPFD and CO2 concentrations were also measured. Q. ilex experienced lower E rates and higher A rates and WUE than P. latifolia throughout the experimental period, but during summer drought these differences disappeared. Q. ilex exhibited a less cold sensitive behavior whereas P. latifolia showed a more heat {\'A}/drought resistant behavior. Under severe summer drought conditions none of the two species was able to reach a positive carbon gain. Drought treatment produced a slight decrease in Fv/Fm values of Q. ilex plants and a strong decrease in Fv/Fm values of P. latifolia only in winter 2000, when drought stress coincided with cold stress. Drought treatment produced also a slight decrease in ETR values of both species. During midday, A and E rates decreased in drought plots in both species associated to lower photochemical efficiencies. In those drought plots, only P. latifolia was able to increase WUE by reducing transpiration losses during midday. Both species tended to present higher A rates for a given soil humidity in drought than in control plots. However, whereas Q. ilex A rates increased with soil humidity, P. latifolia A rates did not increase above 17\% soil humidity, showing no water availability response above such threshold. It is very likely that mesic species such as Q. ilex lose competitive advantage in the drier environment forecasted for next decades than the more xeric P. latifolia .},
