<!-- Water deficit (WD) triggered a range of morphological and physiological mechanisms in the potato genotypes tested, leading to different yield penalties and indicating a variety of survival strategies by potato. We found root length, SPAD, and SLA to be good indicators for water use efficient (WUE) plants useful for drought tolerance breeding. Most characteristics measure showed differences between treatments, pointing to their value in evaluating the impact of drought. According to (Songsri et al. 2009), enhanced extraction of water and nutrients from the soil due to large root system and long roots is a drought resistance mechanism in potato. Our study showed that the minimal yield losses in some genotypes like CIP398190.89 under WD could be related to its ability to increase its WUE (Figure 4a), by absorbing the limited water and nutrients available in the soil without changing its morphology. However, in our study, the genotype with the longest roots (CIP398201.510) (Fig. 3a) showed the lowest yield (Fig. 2a) and HI (Fig. 2b) under both stressed and non-stressed conditions. In this genotype, the long roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than harvestable yield.  -->
<!-- Another drought resistance mechanism can be the reduction of transpiration achieved by the reduction of leaf area, for example, thick leaves often have greater photosynthetic capacity than thin leaves, due to their higher chlorophyll per leaf area counts (Songsri et al. 2009). SPAD is an indicator of the photosynthetically active light transmittance characteristics of the leaf, which is dependent on the unit amount of chlorophyll per unit leaf area. SPAD units have been correlated with chlorophyll and carotenoid content in potato and other crops (RamÃ­rez et al. 2014: Marenco et al. 2009) and are used in selecting genotypes tolerant to drought in breeding programs. In this study, some genotypes reduced specific leaf area (SLA) (Fig. 2c), and changed the ratio of root to shoot (Sup. Table 1), while others, like CIP3977077.16 and CIP398190.89 maintained SLA, as well as harvest index (HI) (Fig. 2b), root length and stolon mass (Fig. 3) under WD. These genotypes may have lower sink competition and allocated a proportionally higher fraction of assimilates to tubers by reducing the evaporative surface area above-ground and efficiently employing the resources (water saved and N) located in the soil. Conversely, sensitive genotypes such as CIP398203.244 preferred to produce leaves and stems in preference to tubers. Our study also found a lower specific leaf area (SLA) under WD (Figure 2c), principally explained by decreases in new leaf production, number of leaves, and leaf size. This decrease might have had allowed a reduction in leaf transpiration, saving water for tuber bulking as suggested by Lahlou, et al. (2003). Hence, potato genotypes with the ability to maintain higher SPAD and lower SLA under WD conditions, can maintain higher WUE under WD conditions. -->

<!-- It is important to remember that under WW conditions, soil can supply water at a steady rate to meet the transpiration demand. However, as the soil becomes dry, water flux from soil to root surface decreases and cannot satisfy the demand of transpiration. Additionally, in WD conditions, mineralization and supply of nutrients, especially N, is reduced, forcing the plant to use their resources efficiently as the only solution to not compromise yield (Motalebifard et al. 2013). Payne et al. (1995) found that N uptake was linearly related to plant transpiration, and that about twice as much N is taken up per kg of transpiration in water-stressed plants than in non-water-stressed plants. In our study, we found that CIP397077.16 and CIP398208.620 could maintain turgor, which, combined with the reduction of SLA, helped them to conserve water. Additionally, increased amounts of RWC under WD treatment in CIP720088 may have been the result of higher stomata conductivity, since the root length of CIP720088 in WW and WD treated plants were comparable (Figure 3a).  -->

<!-- The strong correlation between WUE in this experiment and tuber yield (r = 0 .78, p < .001) indicates direct association between them, and at the same time, reflected the conservative relationship between biomass production and WUE through a range of limited soil water availability.  Reduced stomatal conductance can constrain the diffusion of CO2 for photosynthesis, and accordingly the average total biomass in the WD treatment was significantly lower than that of the corresponding genotypes in WW treatment. Different studies have measured WUE at the leaf, whole plant, and crop levels (Guoju et al. 2013; Hochman et al. 2009) and have found no significant differences at plant or crop levels (Deblonde et al. 1999). In this study, WUE is considered a critical trait that can affect yield and its increase can lead a plant to tolerate or avoid water deficit conditions.  -->
