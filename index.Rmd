# Abstract {-}

Drought stress is one of the major causes of damage and subsequent reduction in yield in all crops worldwide, and the problem is only expected to get worse with water deficits stemming from climate change and population expansion. Thus, the need to bred plants with improve water use efficiency and reduce yield loss. Potato is one of the most important food crop worldwide and modern cultivars are highly sensitive to drought. The aim of the present work is to study the physiological responses of potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L) under drought stress in controlled condition. In order to explore the different responses and understand the mechanisms of tolerance to drought stress, we evaluated fifteen potato genotypes under well-watered (WD) and water deficit (WD) conditions for a range of agro-physiological traits. Genotypes with better mechanisms for avoid the water shortage and maintain the yield production were CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219 and CIP398208.620, which were able to preferentially use the limited water in tuber production rather than biomass accumulation. Multivariate analysis shown that these genotypes have a high production under WW conditions and increasing the photosynthetic activity under WD with better water use efficiency for tuber production (wuet). Variables such as harvest index (hi), root dry weight (rdw), relative chlorophyll content (rcc) and chlorophyll concentration (spad) provide useful information for select potato genotypes under drought stress in breeding programs.

**Key words:** abiotic stress, harvest index, lysimeter, drought tolerance, SPAD

# Introduction

Water has become a scarce and precious resource and its efficient utilization in the production of food is a key challenge in agriculture worldwide and drought is one of the most uncontrollable and pervasive factors and one of the global problems limiting production [@obidiegwu2015Coping]. Tracking the consequences of water deficit in plants is a difficult task, as it depends on the timing, intensity, type of crop, and duration of stress [@blum2011Drought]. Under field conditions, drought caused drastic losses in potato tuber yield and/or quality [@yang2016Identification; @stark2013Potato]. 

Potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L.) is the fourth most important food crop worldwide with an annual production of around 380 million tons [@birch2012Crops]. Potato is an autotetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) and suffers from acute inbreeding depression [@xu2011Genome] which contributes to a significant barrier for traditional breeding approaches [@kaminski2015Contrasting]. Potato is known to be sensitive to water deficit because of its shallow root system, and its fast-closing leaf stomata that reduce transpiration and photosynthesis, considerably reducing tuber yields [@deblonde2001Effects; @joshi2016Potato]. In potato, tolerance to drought is a very complex trait [@anithakumari2012Genetic], some QTLs were associated at different agro-morphological traits [@khan2015Multiple] under drought stress and about 2000 deferentially expressed genes were revealed in potato in response to water deficit [@watkinson2006Accessions] and some genes are related at memory effect on stress with higher expression level when drought occurs again [@chen2020Transcriptome].

Potato is sensitive to periodic water shortage and tuber initiation is the most critical period of a potato’s life span.  Its high demand and management of water of around 400 to 600 L for 1kg of tuber dry matter [@stark2013Potato; @monneveux2013Drought; @sprenger2016drought] has a marked influence on plant behavior, tuber production, and quality. The modern potato cultivars are very sensitive and variable in response to soil drought [@monneveux2013Drought; @soltys-kalina2016effect; @sprenger2016drought]. Therefore, physiological behavior of the plants under drought stress could provide information on their capacity to tolerate water shortage. Differences response have been observed to be caused by drought stress in terms of morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes among species and cultivars [@liu2005ABA; @liu2006Effects].). Climate change pressure increase the need to identify potato genotypes that exhibit high tolerance to abiotic stresses [@monneveux2014Drought]. 

The present study tries to elucidate the mechanisms for drought tolerance and yield in fifteen potato genotypes including two commercial varieties, which are known to arise in water-limited conditions. The relation between traits to mitigate yield losses under water-limited conditions was explored by evaluating and identifying convenient indicators that may help in the selection of tolerant genotypes.

# Materials and Methods

## Plant material

Two commercial varieties and thirteen potato genotypes were selected from the advanced breeding population collection of the International Potato Center (CIP), Table \@ref(tab:gnt). The commercial varieties were, UNICA (CIP392797.22) with a good response to warm and dry environments [@demirel2020Physiological; @gutierrez-rosales2007UNICA; @rolando2015Leaf]; and Achirana INTA (CIP720088) known for their earliness and drought tolerance [@schafleitner2007Field].

## Experimental conditions

The experiment was carried out in complete randomize block design where the first factor was the two irrigation treatments: well-watered (WW), treatment where the moisture was maintained at field capacity and water deficit (WD) with a gradual reduction in the water application. The second factor were the fifteen potato genotypes (Table \@ref(tab:gnt)). Each treatment consisted of five replicates with one potato plant for each experimental unit. 

## Cultivation and management

The experiment was conducted at the International Potato Center (CIP) experimental station in Lima, Peru (12.1◦ S, 77.0◦ W, 244 m.a.s.l.). The plants were grown in an environmentally controlled greenhouse at 28/15°C day/night with 70±5% average relative humidity (HOBO U12 Outdoor/Industrial model, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA). Single plants were grown in a greenhouse in 5 liters plastic pots and containing 5 kg of dry commercial Sogemix SM2 (75% Peat Moss, perlite, vermiculite, and limestone). The potato tubers were pre-sprouted for 2 weeks in dark chamber and planted after in pots at 5–7 cm depth. Fertilization was done each pot twice. At planting, mixed with the substrate, 10 g of a mixture of granular fertilizers composed by CO(NH~2~)~2~ (urea; 46% N), KCl (potassium chloride; 60% K~2~O) and (NH~4~)~2~HPO~4~ (diammonium phosphate, 18% N and 46% P~2~O~5~) with a ratio of 2:1:2, respectively. And 40 days after planting (dap) with 5 g of urea, before starting treatment.

## Transpiration rate and soil water supply

All pots were maintained at well-water conditions until 35 dap. Where the pots were watered to soak and then allowed to drain overnight to remove water excess. The next day, pots were sealed with polyethylene bags to avoid the water loss by evaporation from soil surface. The inter-daily weight of the pots was carried out up to 45 dap to calculate the initial parameters for the treatment application. Drought treatment were imposed at 45 dap that coincides with the beginning of the development of the stolons, with the lysimeter methodology. In order to expose plants under WD at progressive drought, 150 ml of water was reduced in each irrigation, and plants under WW condition were irrigated according to their transpiration demand. Transpiration was calculated by weighing the pots every two days between 13:00 and 15:00 hours (GMT -05:00). The transpiration of each plant was calculated by the procedure previously described by @bhatnagar-mathur2007Stressinducible and @ray1998effect. The inter-daily transpiration rates of WD plants were normalized against WW plant rates to reduce the influence of day-to-day variation ($TRS=\left(\frac{WD_{transpiration}}{WW_{transpiration\ average}}\right)$). The normalization was achieved by dividing transpiration of each individual plant in the WD regime by the mean transpiration of the WW plants. For compare the transpiration between plants, a second normalization was done so that the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) of each plant was defined in 1.0 when the soil water content in each pot was at field capacity [@sinclair1986Influence]. The available soil water or the fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw), for each pot was calculated by dividing the pot weight minus the final pot weight by the transpirable soil water of that pot ($FTSW=\left(\frac{pot\ weight_{inter-daily}-pot\ weight_{final}}{pot\ weight_{initial}-pot\ weight_{final}}\right)$). 

## Evaluated traits

**Water use efficiency (wue).**  is defined as a ratio of biomass accumulation, total crop biomass or crop grain yield, to water consumed, expressed as transpiration, evapotranspiration, or total water input to the system [@sinclair1984WaterUse]. According to this concept we calculated the biomass water use efficiency (wue~b~) and tuber water use efficiency (wue~t~). The wue~b~ was calculated as the total biomass in dry weight produced divided by the cumulative water transpired [@dallacosta1997Yield] and for wue~t~ we used the dry weight from tuber production divide by the total water transpired (trs) during the treatment. 

**Relative water content (rwc).** was determined by weighing the third leaflet in fresh weight (FW) from the third leaf from the apical part from the youngest fully expanded leaf of each plant. Each leaflet was placed in a 4x3 inch Ziploc bag containing distilled water for 24 hours and after this time it was removed to taking turgid weight (TW) afterwards it was dried in an oven at 90ºC for 24 hours and weighed (DW). The rwc was calculated according to @vasquez-robinet2008Physiological by the formula $RWC\left(\%\right)=\left(\frac{leaflet_{FW}-leaflet_{DW}}{leaflet_{TW}-leaflet_{DW}}\right)\cdot100$.

**Leaf osmotic potential (lop).** was determined using a dew point microvoltmeter (HR-33T Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with leaf discs of 5 mm diameter, taken from the third fully extended leaf. The leaf discs were put in 1 ml cryogenic tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. The frozen leaves were incubated at 22°C for 30 min in a sealed C-52 chamber (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA). 

**Chlorophyll concentration (spad).** The chlorophyll content of the plant was evaluated in three points (upper, middle and lower leaflet of a leaf) of the third youngest fully expanded leaf. Measurements to obtain the relative concentration of chlorophyll molecules per unit area of the leaf surface [@ling2011Use] were taken with a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan). Individual readings of leaflets were averaged to represent individual measurement of a leaf. The evaluations were done on light adapted leaves at 29, 59, 76, and 83 day after planting (dap).

**Post-harvest traits.** The harvest was at 90 dap and the plants were separated in four components: leaves, stems, roots and tubers. The dry weight (g) components were determined by drying them at 80°C for 3 days in a forced air oven: leaf (ldw), stem (sdw), root (rdw), tuber (tdw). The leaf area (lfa;cm^2^) in each plants was measured by taking photographs of all the leaves arranged on a wooden board and analyzing them using ImageJ software [@zarate-salazar2018Comparacao; @rueden2017ImageJ2]. 

**Indices.** The harvest index (hi) was calculated as the ratio of tdw related to the total dry biomass (tdb) and specific leaf area (sla) was calculated by dividing the leaf area (lfa) with lead dry weight (ldw). The relative chlorophyll content (rcc) were calculated with the relation between spad at 83 dap (spad_83) and leaf area (lfa) multiplied by 100 for better scale interpretation.

## Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis and graphs were performed in the statistical software R [@R-base]. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the differences between the factors and the comparison of the means with the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p<0.05) with agricolae and GerminaR package [@lozano-isla2019GerminaR; @R-agricolae]. A Student's t-test was performed between well water and water deficit treatment (p<0.05). For the multivariate analysis, correlation and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed with FactoMineR and heatmaply package [@galili2018heatmaply; @R-FactoMineR]. For compute the hierarchical clustering between treatments and genotypes were used the Euclidean distance [@le2008FactoMineR]. For reproducible analysis, the code and statistical analysis used in this manuscript are available in the following GitHub repository <https://github.com/flavjack/20130515LM>.

# Result

## Treatment application

Differences among treatments were noted after 4 days. The fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw) in WW plants the water availability was maintained above 70%, while for the WD treatment the gradual restriction in water supply decreased the water availability. By the end of the experiment the plants in WD had less than 10% of ftsw (Figure \@ref(fig:srl)A). In the case of the transpiration rate, the reduction in the plants in WD was visible after 8 days of after water restriction (Figure \@ref(fig:srl)B).

## Agro-phisological traits 

The chlorophyll concentration (spad) was taken over the course of plant development (29, 59, 76, and 83 dap)  (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). At 29 dap all plants were at the same level as no treatment was applied (Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)E). At 59, 76 and 83 dap the spad shown differences in each evaluation and at the end of the experiment the spad values were lower than at 29 dap and the WD values for all the genotypes were higher than the ones at WW conditions. The genotypes CIP398190.89 and CIP720088 had the lowest differences among treatments for spad at 83 dap (2.06 and 0.30, respectively), while CIP398203.244 and CIP398208.33 had the largest (14.48 and 17.54, respectively) (Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)F).

Leaf relative water content (rwc) and leaf osmotic potential (lop) significantly (p<0.01) decreased in response to WD in all the genotypes (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). The values ranged between 64.96% and 50.09% for CIP720088 and CIP398201.510, respectively. The specific leaf area (sla) reduction was 48% under WD compared to WW (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). CIP398190.89 together with CIP398203.5 were among the clones with lowest reduction (24 and 21% respectively), while CIP398208.219, CIP398098.119, and CIP398208.704 were among the clones with highest sla reduction with 53, 65, and 64% respectively.

Plant high (hgt), leaf dry weight (ldw), stem dry weight (std), leaf area (lfa) decrease significantly (p<0.01) under drought treatment, Table \@ref(tab:svt). In the case of lfa there was a drastic reduction with 65% in plants under WD compare with WW plants, Table \@ref(tab:svt), Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)B. While the components such as number of tuber (ntub), root dry weight (rdw) and root length (rdl) did not shown differences between the treatments (p>0.5).

The relative chlorophyll content (rcc) is the relation between the chlorophyll concentration in the leaves (spad) in relation with the leaf area. It has been shown difference between treatment (p<0.001) and it was able to discriminate plants in WW and WD genotypes (Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)B). The genotypes with best performance in rcc were CIP720088 (Achirana-INTA), CIP398208.620, CIP398208.704, CIP398201.510, CIP392797.22 (UNICA) and CIP397077.16 (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)B).

## Yield components

Differences existed among genotypes in total dry biomass (tdb) of well-watered (WW) plants at the end of the experiment (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). Water deficit (WD) treatment had a significant effect (p<0.001) with an average reduction of around 32% in comparison with the well-watered treatment (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). 

In terms of productivity, WD decreased tuber yield (tdw) across genotypes by an average of 40% (p<0.001). CIP398190.89 had greater tuber dry weight (g) in WD compared to its yield in WW treatment with a 5% increase in biomass, while others genotypes like CIP398203.5 and CIP398203.244 presented up to 56% and 48% reduced tuber production (Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)A). The genotypes CIP398203.244, CIP398180.612, and CIP398201.510 were among the most sensitive genotypes at 31.56, 46.75 and 48.88% respectively under WD. For harvest index (hi), differences among genotypes (p<0.001) and treatments (p<0.02) were found (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). 

Biomass water use efficiency (wue~b~) was generally higher in WD than WW plants (p<0.001) (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). Under WD treatment, CIP397077.16, CIP398208.620, CIP392797.22 and CIP398190.89 showed the highest wue~b~ with 13.06, 12.03, and 11.59 g.L^-1^, respectively (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)A). The lowest wue~b~ with 8.50 and 9.24 g.L^-1^ were presented by CIP398180.612 and CIP398203.5, respectively. For Tuber Water Use efficiency (wue~t~) there is not difference between treatments (p=0.5) (Table \@ref(tab:svt)). The genotypes with better wue~t~ under WD were CIP397077.16, CIP392797.22, CIP720088 and CIP398208.620 (Figure \@ref(fig:srl) and \@ref(fig:mpv)D).

## Multivariate analysis

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the two first dimension explains 64.9% of the variance in the experiment. In the first dimension trs (r=0.94), lfa (r=0.93), tbd (r=0.86), sla (r=0.81), tdw (r=0.73) and ldw (r=0.72) show a high correlation and association with WW treatment, in the other side rcc (r=-0.73), spad (r~-0,63) shown an negatives correlation and association with WD treatment. In the second dimension rdl (r=0.88) and rdw (r=0.87) have a high correlation and associated at WW treatment and negative correlated with hi (-0.92) and wue~t~ (-0.90) and associated to WD treatment (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)).

The clustering analysis show 5 groups and it could be associated in 2 different ways. The first association could by classified by the treatment applied, the cluster 4 and 5 are the well water treatments (WW) and the cluster 2 and 3 associated at the water deficit treatment (WD); the second association is the cluster 1, 3 and 5 with tolerate to water stress, in addition they shown a correlation with wue~t~, hi and tdw, traits that are important in the yield component (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)). The association between the cluster and variables shown that the genotypes in the cluster 2 are positive correlated with the spad, rdl and rdw and negative correlated to tdw, hi and wue~t~. The genotypes in the cluster 3 and 1 are positive associated with the rcc and wue~b~. In the cluster 4 the genotypes are positive correlated with ldw, tdb, lfa and trs. The cluster 5 is associated with sla, tdw and rwc and negative associated with spad and rdw (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)).

According the Pearson correlation analysis (Figure S\@ref(fig:cor)) values of tdb and trs were strongly and positively correlated with 0.93 (p<0.05) with Euclidean distance of 0.91 (Figure S\@ref(fig:cor)). The spad measurements shown good correlation between them (r~0.80) and at negative correlation with hi (r=-0.07). A negative correlation (r= -0.73) among rdw and hi was found with a Euclidean distance of 4.96. A strong correlation between hi and wue~t~ was found (r=0.92) with an Euclidean distance of 0.68, shown not only a good correlation but also a good association between these two variables (Figure S\@ref(fig:cor)). Tuber dry weight (tdw) shown correlation with hi (r=0.61) and wue~t~ (r=0.55) and wue~b~ (r=0.05) with a Euclidean distance of the traits 4.96, shown low association with tdw and wue~b~ (Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and S\@ref(fig:cor)). We also found correlation between hi and wue~t~ was 0.92 with a Euclidean distance 0.91 and a negative correlation with spad (-0.7) at 38 days after treatment application. 

Interesting the association between spad with tdw since the application of the drought treatment (Table \@ref(tab:svt)) is negative (r=~0.60) and Euclidean distance of 4.21 shown no association between them. Apparently spad measure is sensitive to detect the drought stress and it is related with the tuber production (Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and S\@ref(fig:cor)). The inclusion in the analysis of the relative chlorophyll content (rcc) was able to differentiate the genotypes by their photosynthetic and water use efficiency (Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and \@ref(fig:mpv)B).

# Discussion

> Your discussion is unclear. I suggest you to rewrite it using your conclusions as a way to drive the lector through your results.

Under well water conditions, soil can supply water at a steady rate to meet the transpiration demand. However, as the soil becomes dry, water flux from soil to root surface decreases and cannot satisfy the demand of transpiration. Water stress reduces photosynthetic efficiency which is mainly caused by stomatal limitation and have a negative effect during tuber initiation and bulking reducing the production of photo-assimilates and plant growth [@onder2005Different; @obidiegwu2015Coping; @plich2020Relations]. In the present work we apply gradually reduction of the water supply under controlled condition and evaluate the process in fifteen genotypes. In field conditions the abiotic stress is a combination of several factors and not only  drought or heat of both at the same time, thus study the physiological mechanisms of tolerance to water stress in potato is necessary to be perform under control conditions [@zegada-lizarazu2013Photosynthetic; @kaminski2015Contrasting].

It is very difficult to define a trait or index capable to determine tolerance to drought stress in potato as each genotypes can achieve it using different strategies. From an agronomical point of view, maintaining yield levels during drought is crucial [@boguszewska-mankowska2018Divergent]. When the crop have a water shortage the increase of their efficiency in the biomass translocation to maintain tuber yield with high harvest index and tuber water use efficiency, is the best alternative to cope with the stress [@kaminski2015Contrasting; @reddy2020Leaf].

Plant biomass accumulation and yield was shown to be inextricably linked to transpiration [@sinclair1984WaterUse]. The tolerance to drought in potato is a combination of mechanism and the response change amount the different groups of genotypes with difference morpho-physiological adaptation. Potato genotypes under water stress have a reduction in their transpiration rate based in the reduction of the leaf area, decreased plant growth, tuber yield, tubers per plant and tuber size and quality [@dallacosta1997Yield; @yuan2003Effects; @rolando2015Leaf; @aliche2020Morphological]. One mechanism to drought resistance is the reduction of transpiration achieved by the reduction of leaf area with thick leaves which often have greater photosynthetic capacity than thin leaves, due to their higher chlorophyll per leaf area [@songsri2009Association; @rolando2015Leaf]. For this reason genotypes that shown increase in their relative chlorophyll content (rcc) under drought stress were associated with better water use efficiency as mechanisms to mitigate the yield reduction.

Potato genotypes with the ability to maintain high relative chlorophyll content under WD conditions, can maintain higher wue~t~ and hi, reducing the losses in the tuber production. Minimal yield losses in some genotypes like CIP398190.89 under WD could be related to its ability to increase their rcc and reduce the production of roots and leafs resulting in a better  wue~t~ using the limited water and nutrients available in the soil without a drastically reduction in the final yield (Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and \@ref(fig:mpv)A). We did not find difference in root length and root dry weight maybe because root development in all cultivars was limited by the volume of the pots, in which plants were grown [@soltys-kalina2016effect]. But differentiation of the architecture of the potato root system were found in several potato cultivars in the field [@zarzynska2017Differences]. Sensitive genotypes such as CIP398203.244 and CIP398201.510 preferred to produce leaves and more roots instead of tubers. In this genotype, the more roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than yield components in contradiction to @songsri2009Association who mention that enhanced extraction of water and nutrients from the soil due to large root system and long roots is a drought resistance mechanism in peanut. However, a deeper and more extensive rooting system may have drawbacks, because a greater root biomass would almost surely result in a low harvest index in potato (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)A). 

Potatoes are considered to use water more efficiently than cereals [@shahnazari2007Effects]. Genotypes in this study under drought stress reduced their harvest index in 11% compared with WW plants, similar results were found for @schafleitner2007Field with 14% under terminal drought, in comparison with other tuber crops like Jerusalem artichoke with a reduction of 57% under water stress [@ruttanaprasert2016Effects] showing that potato have moderate reduction under drought stress. A good relation between harvest index and water use efficiency for tuber production (wue~t~) were found (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)A and S\@ref(fig:cor)). Genotypes like CIP392797.22 (UNICA) and CIP397077.16 did not present differences in harvest index under well water and drought treatment, in agreement with the results found by @saravia2016Yield. @deguchi2010Aboveground and @mcvetty1980Breeding suggested that one of the main variables for yield increases seen to be the increases in harvest index. Harvest index has been found to be relatively stable for a particular cultivars over wide range of conditions [@donald1976Biological; @khan2015Multiple]. @passioura1977Grain have argued that obtaining high harvest indexes underwater-limited conditions is especially important obtaining high water-use efficiency even if many crops it appears that further substantial improvements in harvest index are unlikely [@mcvetty1980Breeding].

The chlorophyll content is an indicator of the photosynthetic active and light transmittance of the leaf and correlated with a + b chlorophyll concentration [@lichtenthaler1983Determinations], usually related with the nitrogenous status and crop senescence [@kaminski2015Contrasting; @saravia2016Yield] and useful factor for assessing environmental stress resistance [@gao2015maize; @ramirez2014Chlorophyll]. The spad measurement have been correlated with chlorophyll and carotenoid content in potato and other crops [@ramirez2014Chlorophyll] and could allow to discriminate drought tolerance genotypes [@rolando2015Leaf; @saravia2016Yield]. The multivariate analysis shown that genotypes under drought stress increase their spad content [@rodriguez-perez2017Drought] for offset the reduction in the leaf area with thicker leaves because the impose of drought decrease severely the leaf area in all genotypes and water turgor loss [@rolando2015Leaf; @ramirez2014Chlorophyll], this phenomenon causes the plant to try to be more efficient with less leaf area and increase the photosynthetic activity reflected in the quantity of chlorophyll related to the leaf area that in this work we denominated relative chlorophyll content (Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)B). All genotypes under WW condition have in average the same values of rcc, but it changes for WD conditions showing genotypes with better performance in this index and it is related with the water use efficiency (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)). Include the rcc in the multivariate analysis allows to discern between the best genotypes under WD deficit such as CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219, 	CIP398208.620 (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)); and the same genotypes shown good response in tuber production under WW condition. These genotypes have better water use efficiency and harvest index for tuber production (Figure \@ref(fig:mva)). In previous works, @saravia2016Yield presented that two of the five selected genotypes, CIP392797.22 (UNICA) and CIP397077.16, are tolerant to drought in terms of yield maintenance and used the N present in the soil more efficiently, also under drought.

The present work gives an overview of the behavior of different potato genotypes under drought stress and the penalty for the yield causes by the water shortage. Water stress triggered a range of morphological and physiological mechanisms in the tested potato genotypes. Most measured characteristics shown differences between treatments, pointing to their value in evaluating the impact of drought. Uni-variate analysis shows that it is limited to understand the response of the potato under drought stress. A fast screening traits would be helpful in selecting valuable genotypes with defined growth strategies that translate to drought tolerance and are suitable for experiments and/or breeding [@soltys-kalina2016effect]. Variables such as the relative chlorophyll content, harvest index, spad and root dry weight are outlined to be a good indicators for tuber water use efficient, been useful traits for direct and indirect selection under drought stress conditions using fast, easy and inexpensive evaluations for first stage of breeding programs in potato where is required to plant high number of accessions. 

# Conclusions

Tolerant genotypes like CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219, 	CIP398208.620 preferentially use available water for tuber production rather than biomass production represented by their high wue~t~. The genotypes with high harvest index and relative chlorophyll content with less root dry weight present mechanisms for drought avoiding and be good indicators for tuber water use efficient. These traits could be useful as selection criteria for first stage breeding programs because are easy and chip to measure in large populations.
