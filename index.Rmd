# Abstract {-}

Drought stress is a serious constraint affecting yields of almost all crops worldwide. The problem is only expected to get worse with water deficits stemming from climate change and population expansion. In this study, we aim to: find traits that can help the plants tolerate water deficit (WD) without the resultant yield penalties, understand the mechanisms of tolerance, and provide useful information for the selection of tolerance in breeding programs. In order to explore the different responses of potato under drought, we have evaluated fifteen genotypes under well watered and WD conditions for a range of agro-morphological and physiological traits. Critically, tolerant genotypes such as CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, and UNICA were able to preferentially put limited water toward tuber production rather than biomass. We also found a lower specific leaf area (SLA) under WD, and that potato genotypes with the ability to maintain high SPAD and low SLA under WD can also maintain high WUE. 


**Key words:** water use efficiency; water deficit; abiotic stress; harvest index
