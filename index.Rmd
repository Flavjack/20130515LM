# Abstract {-}

Drought stress is one of the major causes of damage and subsequent reduction in yield all crops worldwide and the problem is only expected to get worse with water deficits stemming from climate change and population expansion so, It is need to be bred plants for improve water use efficiency and reduce the yield loss. Potato is one of most important food crop worldwide and modern cultivars are highly sensitive to drought. The aim of the present work is to study the physiological responses of potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L) under drought stress in controlled condition. In order to explore the different responses, we evaluated fifteen genotypes under well watered (WD) and water deficit (WD) conditions for a range of agro-physiological traits and understand the mechanisms of tolerance to drought stress. Genotypes with better mechanisms for avoid the water shortage and maintain the yield production are CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219 and CIP398208.620 were able to preferentially use the limited water in tuber production rather than biomass accumulation. Multivariate analysis shown that this genotypes have a high production under WW conditions and increasing the photosynthetic activity under WD with better water use efficiency for tuber production (wue~t~). Variables such as harvest index (hi), root dry weigth (rdw), relative chlorophyll content (rcc) and chlorophyll concentration (spad) provide useful information for select potato genotypes under drought stress in breeding programs.

**Key words:** abiotic stress, harvest index, lisimeter, drought tolerance, SPAD

# Introduction

Water has become a scarce and precious resource and its efficient utilization in the production of food is a key challenge in agriculture worldwide and drought is one of the most uncontrollable and pervasive factors and one of the global problems limiting production [@obidiegwu2015Coping]. Tracking the consequences of water deficit in plants is a difficult task, as it depends on the timing, intensity, type of crop, and duration of stress [@blum2011Drought]. Under field conditions, drought caused drastic losses in potato tuber yield and/or quality [@yang2016Identification; @stark2013Potato]. 

Potato (*Solanum tuberosum* L.) is the fourth most important food crop worldwide with an annual production of around 380 million tons [@birch2012Crops; FAO 2017]. Potato is known to be sensitive to water deficit because of its shallow root system, and its fast-closing leaf stomata that reduce transpiration and photosynthesis, considerably reducing tuber yields [@deblonde2001Effects; @joshi2016Potato] . In potato, tolerance to drought is a very complex trait [@anithakumari2012Genetic], about 2000 deferentially expressed genes were revealed in potato in response to water deficit [@watkinson2006Accessions]. 

Potato is sensitive to periodic water shortage and tuber initiation is the most critical period of a potato’s life span in terms of water due to its high demand of around 400 to 600 L for 1kg of tuber dry matter [@stark2013Potato; @monneveux2013Drought and @sprenger2016drought] and management of water has a marked influence on plant behavior, tuber production, and quality. The modern potato cultivars are highly sensitive to soil drought and variability in response to soil drought is observed [@monneveux2013Drought; @soltys-kalina2016effect; @sprenger2016drought]. Therefore, physiological behavior of the plants under drought stress could provide information on their capacity to tolerate the water shortage. Differences response have been observed in the effects caused by drought stress related to morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular changes among species and cultivars [@liu2005ABA; @liu2006Effects]. Climate change increases the need to identify potato genotypes that exhibit high tolerance to abiotic stresses [@monneveux2014Drought]. 

The present study elucidate the mechanisms for drought tolerance and yield in eleven advanced potato genotypes including two commercial varieties that are likely to arise in water-limited conditions, and explores the interrelationship between traits that help plants to mitigate yield losses under water-limited conditions. Chlorophyll content (spad), relative water content (rwc), osmotic potential (op), specific leaf area (sla), tuber water use efficiency (wue~t~), harvest index (hi), among other traits, were evaluated to identify convenient indicators of plant water status that helps in the selection of genotypes with tolerance to water deficit mitigating the lost in the tuber production.

# Materials and Methods

## Plant material

Thirteen potato clones were selected from advanced breeding population collection at International Potato Center (CIP) and two commercial varieties, Table (\@ref(tab:gnt)). The varieties, UNICA (	CIP392797.22) with a good response to warm and dry environments [@demirel2020Physiological; @gutierrez-rosales2007UNICA; @rolando2015Leaf]; and Achirana INTA (CIP720088) known for their earliness and drought tolerance [@schafleitner2007Field]. 

## Experimental conditions

The experiment was carried out in complete randomize block design where the first factor was the two irrigation treatments: well-watered (WW), treatment where the moisture was maintained at field capacity and water deficit (WD) with a gradual reduction in the water application; the second factor were compound by the fifteen potato genotypes, Table (\@ref(tab:gnt)). Each treatment consisted of five replicates with one potato plant for each experimental unit. 

## Cultivation and management

The experiment was conducted at the International Potato Center (CIP) experimental station in Lima, Peru (12.1◦ S, 77.0◦ W, 244 m.a.s.l.). The plants were grown in an environmentally controlled greenhouse at 28/15°C day/night with 70±5% average relative humidity (HOBO U12 Outdoor/Industrial model, Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA). Single plants were grown in a greenhouse in 5 liters plastic pots and containing 5 kg of dry commercial Sogemix SM2 (75% Peat Moss, perlite, vermiculite, and limestone). The potato tubers were pre-sprouted for 2 weeks in dark chamber and after planted in the pots at 5–7 cm depth. Fertilization was done twice with ammonium nitrate; triple super-phosphate and potassium sulphate, one before planting mixed with the substrate and the other applied at the surface at 40 days after planting (dap).

## Transpiration rate and soil water supply

The pots from both well water (WW) and water deficit (WD) treatments were watered to soaking and then allowed to drain overnight. Next day, soil evaporation was minimized by sealed with a plastic bag and all the pots were weighed and it was defined as the initial pot weight. Water deficits were imposed at 45 dap that coincides with the beginning of the development of the stolons.

Transpiration was calculated by weighing the pots every two days in the between 13:00 and 15:00 hours (GMT -05:00). The transpiration of each plant was calculated by the procedure previously described by @bhatnagar-mathur2007Stressinducible and @ray1998effect. The inter-daily transpiration rates of WD plants were normalized against WW plant rates to reduce the influence of day-to-day variation ($TRS=\left(\frac{WD_{transpiration}}{WW_{transpiration\ average}}\right)$). The normalization was achieved by dividing transpiration of each individual plant in the WD regime by the mean transpiration of the WW plants. For compare the transpiration between plants, a second normalization was done so that the normalized transpiration rate (NTR) of each plant was defined in 1.0 when the soil water content in each pot was at field capacity [@sinclair1986Influence]. The available soil water or the fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw), for each pot was calculated by dividing the pot weight minus the final pot weight by the transpirable soil water of that pot ($FTSW=\left(\frac{pot\ weight_{inter-daily}-pot\ weight_{final}}{pot\ weight_{initial}-pot\ weight_{final}}\right)$). 

## Evaluated traits

**Water use efficiency (wue).**  is defined as a ratio of biomass accumulation, total crop biomass or crop grain yield, to water consumed, expressed as transpiration, evapo transpiration, or total water input to the system [@sinclair1984WaterUse]. According to this concept we calculated the biomass water use efficiency (wue~b~) and tuber water use efficiency (wue~t~). The wue was calculated as the total biomass in dry weight produced divided by the cumulative water transpired [@dallacosta1997Yield] and for wue~t~ was used the dry weight from tuber production divide the total water transpired (trs) during the treatment. 

**Relative water content (rwc).**  was determined by weighing the third leaflet in fresh weight (FW) from the third leaf from the apical part from the youngest fully expanded leaf of each plant. Each leaflet were placing in a 4x3 inch ziploc bag containing distilled water for 24 hours and after these time it was removed to taking turgid weight (TW) afterwards it was dried in an oven at 90ºC for 24 hours and weighed (DW). The rwc was calculated according to @vasquez-robinet2008Physiological by the formula $RWC\left(\%\right)=\left(\frac{leaflet_{FW}-leaflet_{DW}}{leaflet_{TW}-leaflet_{DW}}\right)\cdot100$.

**Leaf osmotic potential (lop).** was determined using a dew point microvoltmeter (HR-33T Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with leaf discs of 5 mm diameter, taken from the third fully extended leaf. The leaf discs were put in 1 ml cryogenic tubes and frozen in liquid nitrogen for further analysis. The frozen leaves were incubated at 22°C for 30 min in a sealed C-52 chamber (Wescor Inc., Logan, UT, USA). 

**Chlorophyll concentration (spad).** The chlorophyll content of the plant was evaluated by taking SPAD measurements using a SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter (Konica Minolta Sensing, Inc., Osaka, Japan) to obtain the relative concentration of chlorophyll molecules per unit area of the leaf surface [@ling2011Use] in the third youngest fully expanded leaf from three points (upper, middle and lower leaflet of a leaf). Individual readings of leaflets were averaged to represent individual measurement of a leaf. The evaluations were done on light adapted leaves at 29, 59, 76, and 83 day after planting (dap). 

**Post-harvest traits.** The harvest was at 90 dap and the plants were separated in four components: leaves, stems, roots and tubers. The dry weight (g) components were determined by drying them at 80°C for 3 days in a forced air oven: leaf (ldw), stem (sdw), root (rdw), tuber (tdw). The leaf area (lfa) of the plants was measured in cm^2^ by taking photographs of all the leaves arranged on a wooden board and analyzing the pictures using ImageJ software [@zarate-salazar2018Comparacao; @rueden2017ImageJ2]. 

**Indices.** The harvest index (hi) was calculated as the ratio of tdw related to the total dry biomass (tdb) and specific leaf area (sla) was calculated by dividing the leaf area (lfa) with lead dry weight (ldw). The relative chlorophyll content (rcc) were calculated with the relation between spad at 83 (spad_83) dap and leaf area (lfa) multiplied by 100 for better scale interpretation.

## Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis and graphs were performed in the statistical software R [@R-base]. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the differences between the factors and the comparison of the means with the Student-Newman-Keuls test (p<0.05) with agricoale and GerminaR package [@lozano-isla2019GerminaR; @R-agricolae]. A Student's t-test was performed between well water and water deficit treatment (p<0.05). For the multivariate analysis, correlation and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed with FactoMineR and heatmaply package [@galili2018heatmaply; @R-FactoMineR]. For compute the hierarchical clustering between treatments and genotypes were used the euclidean distance [@le2008FactoMineR]. For reproducible analysis, the code and statistical analysis used in this manuscript are available in the following github repository <https://github.com/flavjack/20130515LM>.

# Result

## Treatment application

The drought treatment were apply at 45 day after planting (dap) and the fraction of transpirable soil water (ftsw) shown differences 4 day since treatment application. Plants in WW were maintained the water availability in the pots more than 70% while the restriction in the water supply for the WD treatment decrease the water availability until the finalization of the experiment when the plant in WD in average had less than 10% of ftsw, Figure \@ref(fig:srl)A. In the case of the transpiration, the plants in WD reduce their transpiration rate 8 days after water restriction, Figure \@ref(fig:srl)B.

## Agro-phisological traits 

The chlorophyll concentration (spad) was taken over the course of plant development (29, 59, 76, and 83 dap), Table \@ref(tab:svt); showed at 29 dap all plants were at the same level as no treatment was applied, Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)E. At 59, 76 and 83 the spad shown difference en each evaluation and at the end of the experiment the spad values were lower than at 29 dap and the WD values for all the genotypes were higher than the ones at WW conditions. The genotypes CIP398190.89 and CIP720088 had the lowest differences among treatments for spad at 83 dap (2.06 and 0.30, respectively), while CIP398203.244 and CIP398208.33 had the largest (14.48 and 17.54, respectively), Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)F. 

Leaf relative water content (rwc) and leaf osmotic potential (lop) significantly (p<0.01) decreased in response to WD in all the genotypes, Table \@ref(tab:svt). The values ranged between 64.96% and 50.09% for CIP720088 and CIP398201.510, respectively. The specific leaf area (sla) reduction was 48% under WD compared to WW, Table \@ref(tab:svt). CIP398190.89 together with CIP398203.5 were among the clones with lowest reduction (24 and 21% respectively), while CIP398208.219, CIP398098.119, and CIP398208.704 were among the clones with highest sla reduction with 53, 65, and 64% respectively.

Plant high (hgt), leaf dry weight (ldw), stem dry weight (std), leaf area (lfa) decrease significantly (p<0.01) under drought treatment, Table \@ref(tab:svt). In the case of lfa there was a drastic reduction with 65% in plants under WD compare with WW plants, Table \@ref(tab:svt), Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)B. While the components such as number of tuber (ntub), root dry weight (rdw) and root length (rdl) did not shown differences between the treatments (p>0.5).

The relative chlorophyll content (rcc) is the relation between the chlorophyll concentration in the leaves (spad) in relation with the leaf area and It has been shown difference between treatment (p<0.001) and it was able to discriminate plats in WW and WD genotypes, Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)B. The genotyps with best performace in rcc were CIP720088 (Achirana-INTA), CIP398208.620, CIP398208.704, CIP398201.510, CIP392797.22 (UNICA) and CIP397077.16.

## Yield components

Differences existed among genotypes in total dry biomass (tdb) of well-watered (WW) plants at the end of the experiment, Table \@ref(tab:svt). Water deficit (WD) treatment had a significant effect (p<0.001) with an average reduction of around 32% in comparison with the well-watered treatment, Table \@ref(tab:svt). 

In terms of productivity, WD decreased tuber yield (tdw) across genotypes by an average of 40% (p<0.001). CIP398190.89 had greater tuber dry weight (g) in WD compared to its yield in WW treatment with a 5% increase in biomass, while others genotypes like CIP398203.5 and CIP398203.244 presented up to 56% and 48% reduced tuber production, Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)A. The genotypes CIP398203.244, CIP398180.612, and CIP398201.510 were among the most sensitive genotypes at 31.56, 46.75 and 48.88% respectively under WD. For harvest index (hi), differences among genotypes (p<0.001) and treatments (p<0.02) were found, Table \@ref(tab:svt). 

Biomass water use efficiency (wue~b~) was generally higher in WD than WW plants (p<0.001), Table \@ref(tab:svt). Under WD treatment, CIP397077.16, CIP398208.620, CIP392797.22 and CIP398190.89 showed the highest wue~b~ with 13.06, 12.03, and 11.59 g.L^-1^, respectively, Figure \@ref(fig:mva)A. The lowest wue~b~ with 8.50 and 9.24 g.L^-1^ were presented by CIP398180.612 and CIP398203.5, respectively. For Tuber Water Use efficiency (wue~t~) there is not difference between treatments (p=0.5), Table \@ref(tab:svt). The genotypes with better wue~t~ under WD were CIP397077.16, CIP392797.22, CIP720088 and CIP398208.620, Figure \@ref(fig:srl) and Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)D.

## Multivariate analysis

The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the two first dimension explain 64.9% of the variance in the experiment. In the first dimension trs (r=0.94), lfa (r=0.93), tbd (r=0.86), sla (r=0.81), tdw (r=0.73) and ldw (r=0.72) show a high correlation and association with WW treatment, in the other side rcc (r=-0.73), spad (r~-0,63) shown an negatives correlation and association with WD treatment.  In the second dimension rdl (r=0.88) and rdw (r=0.87) have a high correlation and associated at WW treatment and negate correlated with hi (-0.92) and wue~t~ (-0.90) and associated to WD treatment, Figure \@ref(fig:mva).

The clustering analysis show 5 groups and it could be associated in 2 different ways. The first association could by classified by the treatment applied, the cluster 4 and 5 are the well water treatments (WW) and the cluster 2 and 3 associated at the water deficit treatment (WD); the second association is the cluster 1, 3 and 5 with tolerate to water stress, in addiction they shown a correlation with wue~t~, hi and tdw, traits that are important in the yield component, Figure \@ref(fig:mva). The association between the cluster an the variables shown that the genotypes in the cluster 2 are positive correlated with the spad, rdl and rdw and negative correlated to tdw, hi and wue~t~. The genoytpes in the cluster 3 and 1 are positive associated with the rcc and wue~b~. In the cluster 4 the genotypes are positive correlated with ldw, tdb, lfa and trs. The cluster 5 is associated with sla, tdw and rwc and negative associated with spad and rdw, Figure \@ref(fig:mva).

According the Pearson correlation analysis (Figure S\@ref(fig:cor)) values of tdb and trs were strongly and positively correlated with 0.93 (p<0.05) with Euclidean distance of 0.91, Figure S\@ref(fig:cor). The spad measurements shown good correlation between them (r~0.80) and at negative correlation with hi (r=-0.07). A negative correlation (r= -0.73) among rdw and hi was found with a euclidean distance of 4.96. A strong correlation between hi and wue~t~ was found (r=0.92) with an euclidean distance of 0.68, shown not only a good correlation but also a good association between these two variables, Figure S\@ref(fig:cor). Tuber dry weight (tdw) shown correlation with hi (r=0.61) and wue~t~ (r=0.55) than wue~b~ (r=0.05) with a euclidean distance of the traits 4.96, shown low association with tdw and wue~b~, Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and Figure S\@ref(fig:cor). We also found correlation between hi and wue~t~ was 0.92 with a euclidean distance 0.91 and a negative correlation with spad (-0.7) at 38 days after treatment application. 

Interesting association since the application of the drought treatment (Table \@ref(tab:svt)) is between spad with tdw that have negative correlation (r=~0.60) and an euclidean distance of 4.21 shown no association between them. Apparently spad measure is sensitive to the detect the drought stress and it is related with the tuber production, Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and Figure S\@ref(fig:cor). The inclusion in the analysis the relative chlorophyll content (rcc) was able to differentiate the genotypes by their photosynthetic efficiency, Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and Figure \@ref(fig:mpv)B.

# Dicussion

Under well water conditions, soil can supply water at a steady rate to meet the transpiration demand. However, as the soil becomes dry, water flux from soil to root surface decreases and cannot satisfy the demand of transpiration. Water stress reduces photosynthetic efficiency and have a negative effect during tuber initiation and bulking [@onder2005Different]. In the present work we apply gradually reduction of the water supply and evaluate the process in fifteen genotype response under controlled condition, but it is known that in field condition the abiotic stress is a combination of several factor and not only the drought or heat of both at the same time so is necessary study the mechanisms of tolerance to water stress [@zegada-lizarazu2013Photosynthetica]. It is difficult to define a trait or index for determinate the tolerance to drought in the crops because it can be achieved with different strategies in the genotypes, but we are looking for genotypes that in well water condition have a good tuber production and if they have a water shortage they can cope with the stress and increase their efficiency in the biomass translocation for maintain the tuber yield components with high harvest index and tuber water use efficiency. 

Plant biomass accumulation and yield was shown to be inextricably linked to transpiration [@sinclair1984WaterUse]. The tolerance to drought in potato is a combination of mechanism and the response change amount the different groups of genotypes with difference morpho-physiological adaptation. Potato genotypes under water stress have a reduction in their transpiration rate based in the reduction of the leaf area, decreased plant growth, tuber yield, tubers per plant and tuber size and quality [@dallacosta1997Yield; @yuan2003Effects]. One mechanism to drought resistance is the reduction of transpiration achieved by the reduction of leaf area with thick leaves often have greater photosynthetic capacity than thin leaves, due to their higher chlorophyll per leaf area [@songsri2009Association]. For these reason the genotypes that shown increase in their relative chlorophyll content (rcc) under drought stress were associated with better water use efficiency and mitigating the yield reduction.

Potato genotypes with the ability to maintain high relative chlorophyll content under WD conditions, can maintain higher wue~t~ and hi, reducing the losses in the tuber production. Minimal yield losses in some genotypes like CIP398190.89 under WD could be related to its ability to increase their rcc and reduce the production of roots and leafs resulting in a better  wue~t~ using the limited water and nutrients available in the soil without a drasticall reduction in the final yield, Figure \@ref(fig:mva) and \@ref(fig:mpv)A. Sensitive genotypes such as CIP398203.244 and CIP398201.510 preferred to produce leaves and more roots instead of tubers. In this genotype, the long roots seem to contribute to vegetative growth rather than yield components in contradistinction to @songsri2009Association mention enhanced extraction of water and nutrients from the soil due to large root system and long roots is a drought resistance mechanism in peanut. However, a deeper and more extensive rooting system may have drawbacks. A greater root biomass would almost surely result in lowered harvest index. The harvest index did not show large difference between treatments, but wit a high correlation with the water use efficiency for tuber production. @mcvetty1980Breeding suggested that one of the main variables for yield increases seen to date has been increases in harvest index. Harvest index has been found to be relatively stable for a particular cultivar over wide range of conditions [@donald1976Biological]. @passioura1977Grain have argued that obtaining high harvest indexes underwater-limited conditions is especially important obtaining high water-use efficiencies even if many crops it appears that further substantial improvements in harvest index are unlikely [@mcvetty1980Breeding]. 

The chlorophyll content is an indicator of the photosynthetic active and light transmittance of the leaf and correlated with a + b chlorophyll concentration per unit leaf area [@lichtenthaler1983Determinations]. The spad measurment have been correlated with chlorophyll and carotenoid content in potato and other crops [@ramirez2014Chlorophyll] and are used in selecting genotypes tolerant to drought in breeding programs [@rolando2015Leaf; @saravia2016Yield]. The multivariate analysis shown that genotypes under drought stress increase their spad content for offset the reduction in the leaf area with thicker leaves because the impose of drought decrease severely the leaf area in all genotypes, this phenomenon causes the plant to try to be more efficient with less leaf area and increase the photosynthetic activity reflected in the quantity of chlorophyll related to the leaf area that in this work we denominated relative chlorophyll content \@ref(fig:mpv)B. All genotypes under WW condition have in average the same values of rcc, but it changes for WD conditions showing genotypes with better performance in this indice and it is related with the water use efficiency \@ref(fig:mva)A. Include the rcc in the multivariate analysis allows to discern between the best genotypes under WD deficit such as CIP392797.22 (UNICA), 	CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219, 	CIP398208.620, Figure \@ref(fig:mva)B; and the same genotypes shown good response in tuber production under WW condition. In average this genotypes have better water use efficency in tuber production y have more harvet index, Figure \@ref(fig:mva).

In the present work gives an overview of the behavior of different potato genotypes under drought stress and the penalty for the yield causes by the water shortage. Water stress triggered a range of morphological and physiological mechanisms in the tested potato genotypes. Most characteristics measure showed differences between treatments, pointing to their value in evaluating the impact of drought. Uni-variate analysis is limited to understands the response of the potato under drought stress. Variables such as the chlorophyll content, harvest index, spad and root dry weight are outlined to be a good indicators for tuber water use efficient, useful traits for direct and indirect selection to tolerant genotypes to drought stress using fast, easy and inexpensive evaluations for first stage of breeding programs were is required to plant high number of accessions. 

# Conclusions

Tolerant genotypes like CIP392797.22 (UNICA), CIP397077.16, CIP398190.89, CIP398208.219, 	CIP398208.620 preferentially use available water for tuber production rather than biomass production represented by their high wue~t~. The genotypes with high harvest index and relative chlorophyll content with less root dry weight present mechanisms for drought avoiding and be good indicators for tuber water use efficient. This traits could be useful as selection criteria for first stage breeding programs because are easy and chip to measure in large populations.
